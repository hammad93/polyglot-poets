I KNOW a thing that 's most uncommon;
    (Envy, be silent and attend!)
I know a reasonable woman,
    Handsome and witty, yet a friend.
Not warp'd by passion, awed by rumour;
    Not grave through pride, nor gay through folly;
An equal mixture of good-humour
    And sensible soft melancholy.

'Has she no faults then (Envy says), Sir'
    Yes, she has one, I must aver
When all the world conspires to praise her,
    The woman's deaf, and does not hear.
