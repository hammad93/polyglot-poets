Muse, 'tis enough at length thy labour ends,
And thou shalt live, for Buckingham commends.
Let Crowds and Critics now my verse assail, 
Let Dennis write, and nameless numbers rail
This more than pays whole years of thankless pain;
Time, health, and fortune are not lost in vain.
Sheffield approves, consenting Phoebus bends,
And I and Malice from this hour are friends.
