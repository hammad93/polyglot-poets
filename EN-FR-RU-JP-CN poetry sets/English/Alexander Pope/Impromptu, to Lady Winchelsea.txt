In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore,
And cite those Sapho's we admire no more
Fate doom'd the Fall of ev'ry Female Wit,
But doom'd it then when first Ardelia writ.
Of all Examples by the World confest,
I knew Ardelia could not quote the best;
Who, like her Mistress on Britannia's Throne;
Fights, and subdues in Quarrels not her own.
To write their Praise you but in vain essay;
Ev'n while you write, you take that Praise away
Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore,
But shines himself till they are seen no more.
