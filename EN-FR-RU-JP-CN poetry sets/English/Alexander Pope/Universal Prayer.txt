Father of all! In every age, 
In ev'ry clime ador'd, 
By saint, by savage, and by sage, 
Jehovah, Jove, or Lord! 

Thou Great First Cause, least understood, 
Who all my sense confin'd 
To know but this, that Thou art good, 
And that myself am blind 

Yet gave me, in this dark estate, 
To see the good from ill; 
And, binding Nature fast in Fate, 
Left free the human Will. 

What Conscience dictates to be done, 
Or warns me not to do; 
This teach me more than Hell to shun, 
That more than Heav'n pursue. 

What blessings thy free bounty gives 
Let me not cast away; 
For God is paid when man receives; 
T' enjoy is to obey. 

Yet not to earth's contracted span 
Thy goodness let me bound, 
Or think thee Lord alone of man, 
When thousand worlds are round. 

Let not this weak, unknowing hand 
Presume thy bolts to throw, 
And teach damnation round the land 
On each I judge thy foe. 

If I am right, thy grace impart, 
Still in the right to stay; 
If I am wrong, O teach my heart 
To find that better way. 

Save me alike from foolish Pride 
Or impious Discontent, 
At aught thy wisdom has denied, 
Or aught that goodness lent. 

Teach me to feel another's woe, 
To right the fault I see 
That mercy I to others show, 
That mercy show to me. 

Mean tho' I am, not wholly so, 
Since quicken'd by thy breath; 
O lead me whereso'er I go, 
Thro' this day's life or death! 

This day be bread and peace my lot 
All else beneath the sun 
Though know'st if best bestow'd or not, 
And let Thy will be done. 

To Thee, whose temple is of Space, 
Whose altar earth, sea, skies, 
One chorus let all Beings raise! 
All Nature's incense rise!
