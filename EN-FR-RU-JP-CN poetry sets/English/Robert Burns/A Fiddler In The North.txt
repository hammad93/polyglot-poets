Amang the trees, where humming bees,
At buds and flowers were hinging, O,
Auld Caledon drew out her drone,
And to her pipe was singing, O
'Twas Pibroch, Sang, Strathspeys, and Reels,
She dirl'd them aff fu' clearly, O
When there cam' a yell o' foreign squeels,
That dang her tapsalteerie, O.
Their capon craws an' queer ha, ha's,
They made our lugs grow eerie, O;
The hungry bike did scrape and fyke,
Till we were wae and weary, O
But a royal ghaist, wha ance was cas'd,
A prisoner, aughteen year awa',
He fir'd a Fiddler in the North,
That dang them tapsalteerie, O.
