It was upon a Lammas night,
 When corn rigs are bonnie,
Beneath the moon's unclouded light,
 I held away to Annie
The time flew by wi' tentless heed
 Till 'tween the late and early,
Wi' sma' persuasion, she agreed
 To see me thro' the barley.
 Corn rigs, an' barley rigs,
 An' corn rigs are bonnie
 I'll ne'er forget that happy night,
 Amang the rigs wi' Annie.
The sky was blue, the wind was still,
 The moon was shining clearly
I set her down, wi' right good will,
 Amang the rigs o' barley
I ken't her heart was a' my ain
 I lov'd her most sincerely;
I kiss'd her owre and owre again,
 Amang the rigs o' barley.
 Corn rigs...
I lock'd her in my fond embrace;
 Her heart was beating rarely
My blessings on that happy place,
 Amang the rigs o' barley!
But by the moon and stars so bright,
 That shone that hour so clearly!
She aye shall bless that happy night,
 Amang the rigs o' barley.
 Corn rigs...
I ha'e been blythe wi' comrades dear;
 I ha'e been merry drinkin';
I ha'e been joyfu' gatherin' gear;
 I ha'e been happy thinkin'
But a' the pleasures e'er I saw,
 Tho' three times doubled fairly,

That happy night was worth then a',
 Amang the rigs o' barley.
 Corn rigs...
