Forlorn, my Love, no comfort near, 
Far, far from thee, I wander here; 
Far, far from thee, the fate severe, 
At which I most repine, Love. 

Chorus-O wert thou, Love, but near me! 
But near, near, near me, 
How kindly thou wouldst cheer me, 
And mingle sighs with mine, Love. 

Around me scowls a wintry sky, 
Blasting each bud of hope and joy; 
And shelter, shade, nor home have I; 
Save in these arms of thine, Love. 
O wert thou, &c. 

Cold, alter'd friendship's cruel part, 
To poison Fortune's ruthless dart- 
Let me not break thy faithful heart, 
And say that fate is mine, Love. 
O wert thou, &c. 

But, dreary tho' the moments fleet, 
O let me think we yet shall meet; 
That only ray of solace sweet, 
Can on thy Chloris shine, Love! 
O wert thou, &c.
