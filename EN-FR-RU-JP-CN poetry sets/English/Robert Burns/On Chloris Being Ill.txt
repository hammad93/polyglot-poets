Chorus-Long, long the night, 
Heavy comes the morrow 
While my soul's delight 
Is on her bed of sorrow. 

Can I cease to care? 
Can I cease to languish, 
While my darling Fair 
Is on the couch of anguish? 
Long, long, &c. 

Ev'ry hope is fled, 
Ev'ry fear is terror, 
Slumber ev'n I dread, 
Ev'ry dream is horror. 
Long, long, &c. 

Hear me, Powers Divine! 
Oh, in pity, hear me! 
Take aught else of mine, 
But my Chloris spare me! 
Long, long, &c.
