Ca'the yowes to the knowes, 
Ca' them where the heather grows, 
Ca' them where the burnie rowes, 
My bonie Dearie. 

Hark the mavis' e'ening sang, 
Sounding Clouden's woods amang; 
Then a-faulding let us gang, 
My bonie Dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

We'll gae down by Clouden side, 
Thro' the hazels, spreading wide, 
O'er the waves that sweetly glide, 
To the moon sae clearly. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

Yonder Clouden's silent towers,
Where, at moonshine's midnight hours, 
O'er the dewy-bending flowers, 
Fairies dance sae cheery. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

Ghaist nor bogle shalt thou fear, 
Thou'rt to Love and Heav'n sae dear, 
Nocht of ill may come thee near; 
My bonie Dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

Fair and lovely as thou art, 
Thou hast stown my very heart; 
I can die-but canna part, 
My bonie Dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c.
