O SAW ye my Dear, my Philly
O saw ye my Dear, my Philly,
She's down i' the grove, she's wi' a new Love,
She winna come hame to her Willy.
What says she my dear, my Philly
What says she my dear, my Philly
She lets thee to wit she has thee forgot,
And forever disowns thee, her Willy.
O had I ne'er seen thee, my Philly!
O had I ne'er seen thee, my Philly!
As light as the air, and fause as thou's fair,
Thou's broken the heart o' thy Willy.
