Now westlin winds and slaught'ring guns
 Bring autumn's pleasant weather;
And the moorcock springs, on whirring wings,
 Amang the blooming heather;
Now waving grain, wide o'er the plain,
 Delights the weary farmer;
And the moon shines bright, when I rove at night.
 To muse upou my charmer.
The partridge loves the fruitful fells;
 The plover loves the mountains;
The woodcock haunts tbe lonely dell;
 The soaring hern the fountains
Thro' lofty groves the cushat roves,
 The path of man to shun it;
The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush,
 The spreading thorn the linnet.
Thus ev'ry kind their pleasure find,
 The savage and the tender;
Some social join, and leagues combine
 Some solitary wander
Avaunt, away, the cruel sway!
 Tyrannic man's dominion;
The sportsman's joy, the murd'ring cry,
 The flutt'ring, gory pinion!
But Peggy dear, the evening's clear,
 Thick flies the skimming swallow;
The sky is blue, the fields in view,
 All fading-green and yellow
Come let us stray our gladsome way,
 And view the charms of nature;
The rustling corn, the fruited thorn,
 And every happy creature.
We'll gently walk, and sweetly talk,
 Till the silent moon shine clearly;
I'll grasp thy waist, and, fondly prest,

 Swear how I love thee dearly
Not vernal show'rs to budding flow'rs,
 Not autumn to the farmer,
So dear can be as thou to me,
 My fair, my lovely charmer!
My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose
O, my luve is like a red, red rose,
That's newly sprung in June.
O, my love is like a melodie,
That's sweetly play'd in tune.
As fair thou art, my bonnie lass,
So deep in luve am I,
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a' the seas gang dry.
Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi' the sun!
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands of life shall run.
And fare the weel, my only luve!
And fare the well awhile!
And I will come again, my love.
Tho' it were ten thousand mile!
