Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, 
As ever trod on airn; 
But now she's floating down the Nith, 
And past the mouth o' Cairn. 

Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, 
An' rode thro' thick and thin; 
But now she's floating down the Nith, 
And wanting even the skin. 

Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, 
And ance she bore a priest; 
But now she's floating down the Nith, 
For Solway fish a feast. 

Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare, 
An' the priest he rode her sair; 
And much oppress'd and bruis'd she was, 
As priest-rid cattle are,-&c. &c.
