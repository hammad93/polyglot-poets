Coming thro' the rye, poor body,
Coming thro' the rye,
She draiglet a' her petticoatie
Coming thro' the rye.
O, Jenny's a' wat, poor body;
Jenny's seldom dry;
She draiglet a' her petticoatie
Coming thro' the rye.
Gin a body meet a body
Coming thro' the rye,
Gin a body kiss a body&mdash;
Need a body cry
Gin a body meet a body
Coming thro' the glen,
Gin a body kiss a body&mdash;
Need the warld ken
