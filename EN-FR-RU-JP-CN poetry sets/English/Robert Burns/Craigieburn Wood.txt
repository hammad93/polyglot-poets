Sweet closes the ev'ning on Craigieburn Wood, 
And blythely awaukens the morrow; 
But the pride o' the spring in the Craigieburn Wood 
Can yield to me nothing but sorrow. 

Chorus.-Beyond thee, dearie, beyond thee, dearie, 
And O to be lying beyond thee! 
O sweetly, soundly, weel may he sleep 
That's laid in the bed beyond thee! 

I see the spreading leaves and flowers, 
I hear the wild birds singing; 
But pleasure they hae nane for me, 
While care my heart is wringing. 
Beyond thee, &c. 

I can na tell, I maun na tell, 
I daur na for your anger; 
But secret love will break my heart, 
If I conceal it langer. 
Beyond thee, &c. 

I see thee gracefu', straight and tall, 
I see thee sweet and bonie; 
But oh, what will my torment be, 
If thou refuse thy Johnie! 
Beyond thee, &c. 

To see thee in another's arms, 
In love to lie and languish, 
'Twad be my dead, that will be seen, 
My heart wad burst wi' anguish. 
Beyond thee, &c. 

But Jeanie, say thou wilt be mine, 
Say thou lo'es nane before me; 
And a' may days o' life to come 
I'l gratefully adore thee, 
Beyond thee, &c.
