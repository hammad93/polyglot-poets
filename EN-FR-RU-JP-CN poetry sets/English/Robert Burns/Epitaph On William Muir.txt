AN HONEST man here lies at rest
As e'er God with his image blest;
The friend of man, the friend of truth,
The friend of age, and guide of youth
Few hearts like his, with virtue warm'd,
Few heads with knowledge so informed
If there's another world, he lives in bliss;
If there is none, he made the best of this.
