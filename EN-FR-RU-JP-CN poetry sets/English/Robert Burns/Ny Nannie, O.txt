Behind yon hills, where Lugar flows,
 'Mang moors an' mosses many, O,
The wintry sun the day has clos'd,
 And I'll awa to Nannie, O.
The westlin wind blaws loud and shill;
 The night's baith mirk an' rainy, O;
But I'll get my plaid, an' out I'll steal,
 An' owre the hills to Nannie, O.
My Nannie's charming, sweet, an' young
 Nae artfu' wiles to Will ye, O
May ill befa' the flattering tongue
 That wad beguile my Nannie, O.
Her face is fair, her heart is true,
 She's spotless as she's bonnie, O
The op'ning gowan, wet wi' dew,
 Nae purer is than Nannie, O.
A country lad is my degree,
 And few there be that ken me, O;
But what care I how few they be
 I'm welcome aye to Nannie, O.
My riches a' 's my penny-fee,
 An' I maun guide it cannie, O;
But warl's gear ne'er troubles me,
 My thoughts are a' my Nannie, O.
Our auld guidman delights to view
 His sheep and kye thrive bonnie, O;
But I'm as blythe that hauds his pleugh,
 An' has nae care but Nannie, O.
Come weel, come woe, I care na by,
 I'll tak' what Heav'n will sen' me, O;
Nae ither care in life have I,

 But live, an' love my Nannie, O.
