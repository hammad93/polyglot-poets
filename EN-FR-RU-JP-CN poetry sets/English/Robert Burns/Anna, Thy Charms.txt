Yestreen I had a pint o' wine,
 A place where body saw na;
Yestreen lay on this breast o' mine
 The gowden locks of Anna.
The hungry Jew in wilderness
 Rejoicing o'er his manna
Was naething to my hiney bliss
 Upon the lips of Anna.
Ye Monarchs take the East and West
 Frae Indus to Savannah
Gie me within my straining grasp
 The melting form of Anna!
There I'll despise Imperial charms,
 An empress or sultana,
While dying raptures in her arms,
 I give an' take wi' Anna!
Awa, thou flaunting God of Day!
 Awa, thou pale Diana!
Ilk star, gae hide thy twinkling ray,
 When I'm to meet my Anna!
Come, in thy raven plumage, Night
 (Sun, Moon, and Stars, withdrawn a')
And bring an Angel-pen to write
 My transports with my Anna!
The Kirk an State may join, an tell
 To do sic things I maunna
The Kirk an State may gae to Hell,
 And I'll gae to my Anna.
She is the sunshine o' my e'e,
 To live but her I canna
Had I on earth but wishes three,
 The first should be my Anna.
