No sculptured marble here, nor pompous lay, 
"No storied urn nor animated bust;" 
This simple stone directs pale Scotia's way, 
To pour her sorrows o'er the Poet's dust. 

She mourns, sweet tuneful youth, thy hapless fate; 
Tho' all the powers of song thy fancy fired, 
Yet Luxury and Wealth lay by in state, 
And, thankless, starv'd what they so much admired. 

This tribute, with a tear, now gives 
A brother Bard-he can no more bestow: 
But dear to fame thy Song immortal lives, 
A nobler monument than Art can shew. 


Curse on ungrateful man, that can be pleased, 
And yet can starve the author of the pleasure. 
O thou, my elder brother in misfortune, 
By far my elder brother in the Muses, 
With tears I pity thy unhappy fate! 
Why is the Bard unpitied by the world, 
Yet has so keen a relish of its pleasures?
