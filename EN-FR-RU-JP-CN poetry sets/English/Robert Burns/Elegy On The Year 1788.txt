For lords or kings I dinna mourn, 
E'en let them die-for that they're born: 
But oh! prodigious to reflec'! 
A Towmont, sirs, is gane to wreck! 
O Eighty-eight, in thy sma' space, 
What dire events hae taken place! 
Of what enjoyments thou hast reft us! 
In what a pickle thou has left us! 

The Spanish empire's tint a head, 
And my auld teethless, Bawtie's dead: 
The tulyie's teugh 'tween Pitt and Fox, 
And 'tween our Maggie's twa wee cocks; 
The tane is game, a bluidy devil, 
But to the hen-birds unco civil; 
The tither's something dour o' treadin, 
But better stuff ne'er claw'd a middin. 

Ye ministers, come mount the poupit, 
An' cry till ye be hearse an' roupit, 
For Eighty-eight, he wished you weel, 
An' gied ye a' baith gear an' meal; 
E'en monc a plack, and mony a peck, 
Ye ken yoursels, for little feck! 

Ye bonie lasses, dight your e'en, 
For some o' you hae tint a frien'; 
In Eighty-eight, ye ken, was taen, 
What ye'll ne'er hae to gie again. 

Observe the very nowt an' sheep, 
How dowff an' daviely they creep; 
Nay, even the yirth itsel' does cry, 
For E'nburgh wells are grutten dry. 

O Eighty-nine, thou's but a bairn, 
An' no owre auld, I hope, to learn! 
Thou beardless boy, I pray tak care, 
Thou now hast got thy Daddy's chair; 
Nae handcuff'd, mizl'd, hap-shackl'd Regent, 
But, like himsel, a full free agent, 
Be sure ye follow out the plan 
Nae waur than he did, honest man! 
As muckle better as you can.
