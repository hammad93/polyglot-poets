No churchman am I for to rail and to write, 
No statesman nor soldier to plot or to fight, 
No sly man of business contriving a snare, 
For a big-belly'd bottle's the whole of my care. 

The peer I don't envy, I give him his bow; 
I scorn not the peasant, though ever so low; 
But a club of good fellows, like those that are here, 
And a bottle like this, are my glory and care. 

Here passes the squire on his brother-his horse; 
There centum per centum, the cit with his purse; 
But see you the Crown how it waves in the air? 
There a big-belly'd bottle still eases my care. 

The wife of my bosom, alas! she did die; 
for sweet consolation to church I did fly; 
I found that old Solomon proved it fair, 
That a big-belly'd bottle's a cure for all care. 

I once was persuaded a venture to make; 
A letter inform'd me that all was to wreck; 
But the pursy old landlord just waddl'd upstairs, 
With a glorious bottle that ended my cares. 

"Life's cares they are comforts"-a maxim laid down 
By the Bard, what d'ye call him, that wore the black gown; 
And faith I agree with th' old prig to a hair, 
For a big-belly'd bottle's a heav'n of a care.
