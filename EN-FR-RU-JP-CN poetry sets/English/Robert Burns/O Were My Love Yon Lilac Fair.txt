O were my love yon Lilac fair, 
Wi' purple blossoms to the Spring, 
And I, a bird to shelter there, 
When wearied on my little wing! 
How I wad mourn when it was torn 
By Autumn wild, and Winter rude! 
But I wad sing on wanton wing, 
When youthfu' May its bloom renew'd. 

O gin my love were yon red rose, 
That grows upon the castle wa'; 
And I myself a drap o' dew, 
Into her bonie breast to fa'! 
O there, beyond expression blest, 
I'd feast on beauty a' the night; 
Seal'd on her silk-saft faulds to rest, 
Till fley'd awa by Phoebus' light!
