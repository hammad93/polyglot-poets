Ca' the yowes to the knowes, 
Ca' them where the heather grows, 
Ca' them where the burnie rowes, 
My bonie dearie 

As I gaed down the water-side, 
There I met my shepherd lad 
He row'd me sweetly in his plaid, 
And he ca'd me his dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

Will ye gang down the water-side, 
And see the waves sae sweetly glide 
Beneath the hazels spreading wide, 
The moon it shines fu' clearly. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

Ye sall get gowns and ribbons meet, 
Cauf-leather shoon upon your feet, 
And in my arms ye'se lie and sleep, 
An' ye sall be my dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

If ye'll but stand to what ye've said, 
I'se gang wi' thee, my shepherd lad, 
And ye may row me in your plaid, 
And I sall be your dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c. 

While waters wimple to the sea, 
While day blinks in the lift sae hie, 
Till clay-cauld death sall blin' my e'e, 
Ye sall be my dearie. 
Ca' the yowes, &c.
