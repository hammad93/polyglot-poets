There's nane that's blest of human kind
But the cheerful and the gay, man.
Here's a bottle and an honest friend!
What wad ye wish for mair, man
Wha kens, before his life may end,
What his share may be o' care, man
Then catch the moments as they fly,
And use them as ye ought, man!
Believe me, Happiness is shy,
And comes not ay when sought, man!
