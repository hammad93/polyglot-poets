Tune - Go from my window, Love, do.
The sun he is sunk in the west,
All creatures retired to rest,
While here I sit, all sore beset,
With sorrow, grief, and woe
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
The prosperous man is asleep,
Nor hears how the whirlwinds sweep;
But Misery and I must watch
The surly tempest blow
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
There lies the dear partner of my breast;
Her cares for a moment at rest
Must I see thee, my youthful pride,
Thus brought so very low!
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
There lie my sweet babies in her arms;
No anxious fear their little hearts alarms;
But for their sake my heart does ache,
With many a bitter throe
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
I once was by Fortune carest
I once could relieve the distrest
Now life's poor support, hardly earn'd
My fate will scarce bestow
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
No comfort, no comfort I have!
How welcome to me were the grave!
But then my wife and children dearO,
wither would they go!
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
O whither, O whither shall I turn!

All friendless, forsaken, forlorn!
For, in this world, Rest or Peace
I never more shall know!
And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
