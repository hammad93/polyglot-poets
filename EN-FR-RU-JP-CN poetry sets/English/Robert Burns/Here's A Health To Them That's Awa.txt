Here's a health to them that's awa,
 Here's a health to them that's awa
And wha winna wish guid luck to our cause,
 May never guid luck be their fa'!
It's guid to be merry and wise,
 It's guid to be honest and true,
It's guid to support Caledonia's cause
 And bide by the buff and the blue.
Here's a health to them that's awa,
 Here's a health to them that's awa!
Here's a health to Charlie, the chief o' the clan,
 Altho that his band be sma'!
May Liberty meet wi success,
 May Prudence protect her frae evil!
May tyrants and Tyranny tine i' the mist
 And wander their way to the Devil!
Here's a health to them that's awa,
 Here's a health to them that's awa;
Here's a health to Tammie, the Norlan' laddie,
 That lives at the lug o' the Law!
Here's freedom to thern that wad read,
 Here's freedom to them that would write!
There's nane ever fear'd that the truth should be heard,
 But they whom the truth would indite!
Here's a health to them that's awa,
 An here's to them that's awa!
Here's to Maitland and Wycombe! let wha does na like 'em
 Be built in a hole in the wa'!
Here's timmer that's red at the heart,
 Here's fruit that is sound at the core,
And may he that wad turn the buff and blue coat
 Be turn'd to the back o' the door!
Here's a health to them that's awa,
 Here's a health to them that's awa,
Here's Chieftain M'Leod, a chieftain worth gowd,

 Tho' bred amang mountains o' snaw!
Here's friends on baith sides o' the Firth,
 And friends on baith sides o' the Tweed,
And wha wad betray old Albion's right,
 May they never eat of her bread!
