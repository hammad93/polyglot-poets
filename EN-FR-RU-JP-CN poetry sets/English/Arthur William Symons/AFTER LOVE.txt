O TO part now, and, parting now,
     Never to meet again;
To have done for ever, I and thou,
     With joy, and so with pain.

It is too hard, too hard to meet
     As friends, and love no more;
Those other meetings were too sweet
     That went before.

And I would have, now love it over,
     An end to all, an end
I cannot, having been your lover,
     Stoop to become your friend!
