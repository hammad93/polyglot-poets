IF I bid you, you will come,
     If I bid you, you will go,
          You are mine, and so I take you
To my heart, your home;
     Well, ah, well I know
          I shall not forsake you.

I shall always hold you fast,
     I shall never set you free,
          You are mine, and I possess you
Long as life shall last;
     You will comfort me,
          I shall bless you.

I shall keep you as we keep
     Flowers for memory, hid away,
          Under many a newer token
Buried deep,
     Roses of a gaudier day,
          Rings and trinkets, bright and broken.

Other women I shall love,
     Fame and fortune I may win,
          But when fame and love forsake me
And the light is night above,
     You will let me in,
          You will take me.
