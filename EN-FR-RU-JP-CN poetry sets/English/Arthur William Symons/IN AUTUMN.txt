FRAIL autumn lights upon the leaves
     Beacon the ending of the year.
     The windy rains are here,
Wet nights and blowing winds about the eaves.

Here in the valley, mists begin
     To breathe about the river side
     The breath of autumn-tide.
The dark fields wait to take the harvest in.

And you, and you are far away.
     Ah, this it is, and not the rain
     Now loud against the pane,
That takes the light and colour from the day!
