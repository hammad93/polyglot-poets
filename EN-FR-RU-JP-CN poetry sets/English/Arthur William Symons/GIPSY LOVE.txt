THE gipsy tents are on the down,
     The gipsy girls are here;
And it's O to be off and away from the town
     With a gipsy for my dear!

We'd make our bed in the bracken
     With the lark for a chambermaid;
The lark would sing us awake in the mornings
     Singing above our head.

We'd drink the sunlight all day long
     With never a house to bind us;
And we'd only flout in a merry song
     The world we left behind us.

We would be free as birds are free
     The livelong day, the livelong day;
And we would lie in the sunny bracken
     With none to say us nay.

The gipsy tents are on the down,
     The gipsy girls are here;
And it's O to be off and away from the town
     With a gipsy for my dear!
