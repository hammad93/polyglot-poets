WINE, the red coals, the flaring gas,
     Bring out a brighter tone in cheeks
That learn at home before the glass
     The flush that eloquently speaks.

The blue-grey smoke of cigarettes
     Curls from the lessening ends that glow;
The men are thinking of the bets,
     The women of the debts, they owe.

Then their eyes meet, and in their eyes
     The accustomed smile comes up to call,
A look half miserably wise.
     Half heedlessly ironical.
