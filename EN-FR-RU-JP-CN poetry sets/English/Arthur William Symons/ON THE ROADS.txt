THE road winds onward long and white,
     It curves in mazy coils, and crooks
A beckoning finger down the height;
     It calls me with the voice of brooks
To thirsty travellers in the night.

I leave the lonely city street,
     The awful silence of the crowd;
The rhythm of the roads I beat,
     My blood leaps up, I shout aloud,
My heart keeps measure with my feet.

Nought know, nought care I whither I wend
     'Tis on, on, on, or here or there.
What profiteth it an aim or end
     I walk, and the road leads anywhere.
Then forward, with the Fates to friend!

'Tis on and on! Who knows but thus
     Kind Chance shall bring us luck at last_
_ Adventures to the adventurous!
     Hope flies before, and the hours slip past
O what have the hours in store for us

A bird sings something in my ear,
     The wind sings in my blood a song
Tis good at times for a man to hear;
     The road winds onward white and long,
And the best of Earth is here!
