I DANCED at your ball a year ago,
     To-night I pay for your bread and cheese,
And a glass of bitters, if you please,
     For you drank my best champagne, you know!

Madcap ever, you laugh the while,
     As you drink your bitters and munch your bread;
The face is the same, and the same old smile
     Came up at a word I said.

A year ago I danced at your ball,
     I sit by your side in the bar to-night;
And the luck has changed, you say that's all!
     And the luck will change, you say all right!

For the men go by, and the rent's to pay,
     And you haven't a friend in the world to-day;
And the money comes and the money goes
     And to-night, who cares and to-morrow, who knows
