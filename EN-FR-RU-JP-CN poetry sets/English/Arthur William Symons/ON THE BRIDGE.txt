MIDNIGHT falls across hollow gulfs of
night
     As a stone that falls in a sounding well;
Under us the Seine flows through dark and light,
     While the beat of time--hark!--is audible.

Lights on bank and bridge glitter gold and red,
     Lights upon the stream glitter red and white;
Under us the night, and the night overhead.
     We together, we alone together in the night.
