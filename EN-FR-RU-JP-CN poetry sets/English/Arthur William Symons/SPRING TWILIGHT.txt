THE twilight droops across the day,
     I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
     That palely comes and covers all.

The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,
     The menace of the dreary night
But in her face, more fair than morn,
     A sweet suspension of delight.
