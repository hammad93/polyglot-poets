WHEN you were here, ah foolish then!
     I scarcely knew I loved you, dear.
I know it now, I know it when
     You are no longer here.

When you were here, I sometimes tired,
     Ah me! that you so loved me, dear.
Now, in these weary days desired,
     You are no longer here.

When you were here, did either know
     That each so loved the other, dear
But that was long and long ago
     You are no longer here.
