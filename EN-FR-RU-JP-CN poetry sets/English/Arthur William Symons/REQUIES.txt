O IS it death or life
     That sounds like something strangely known
In this subsiding out of strife,
     This slow sea-monotone

A sound, scarce heard through sleep,
     Murmurous as the August bees
That fill the forest hollows deep
     About the roots of trees.

O is it life or death,
     O is it hope or memory,
That quiets all things with this breath
     Of the eternal sea
