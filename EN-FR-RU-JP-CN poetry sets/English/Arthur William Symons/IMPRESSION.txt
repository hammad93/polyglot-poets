THE pink and black of silk and lace,
     Flushed in the rosy-golden glow
Of lamplight on her lifted face;
Powder and wig, and pink and lace,

And those pathetic eyes of hers;
     But all the London footlights know
The little plaintive smile that stirs
The shadow in those eyes of hers.

Outside, the dreary church-bell tolled,
     The London Sunday faded slow;
Ah, what is this what wings unfold
In this miraculous rose of gold
