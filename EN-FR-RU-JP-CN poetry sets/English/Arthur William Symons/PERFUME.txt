SHAKE out your hair about me, so,
     That I may feel the stir and scent
Of those vague odours come and go
     The way our kisses went.

Night gave this priceless hour of love,
     But now the dawn steals in apace,
And amorously bends above
     The wonder of your face.

Farewell between our kisses creeps,
     You fade, a ghost, upon the air;
Yet, ah! the vacant place still keeps
     The odour of your hair.
