COOL comely country Pattie, grown
     A daisy where the daisies grow,
No wind of heaven has ever blown
     Across a field-flower's daintier snow.

Gold-white among the meadow-grass
     The humble little daisies thrive;
I cannot see them as I pass,
     But I am glad to be alive.

And so I turn where Pattie stands,
     A flower among the flowers at play;
I'll lay my heart into her hands,
     And she will smile the clouds away.
