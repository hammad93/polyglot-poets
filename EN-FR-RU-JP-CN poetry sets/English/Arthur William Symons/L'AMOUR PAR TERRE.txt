THE wind the other evening overthrew
     The little Love who smiled so mockingly
     Down that mysterious alley, so that we,
Remembering, mused thereon a whole day through.

The wind has overthrown him! The poor stone
     Lies scattered to the breezes. It is sad
     To see the lonely pedestal, that had
The artist's name, scarce visible, alone,

Oh! it is sad to see the pedestal
     Left lonely! and in dream I seem to hear
     Prophetic voices whisper in my ear
The lonely and despairing end of all.

Oh! it is sad! And thou, hast thou not found
     One heart-throb for the pity, though thine eye
     Lights at the gold and purple butterfly
Brightening the littered leaves upon the ground.
