THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,
     Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
     The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light

Gracile and creamy white and rose,
     Complexioned like the flower of dawn,
Her fleeting colours are as those
     That, from an April sky withdrawn,
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.
