THE wind is rising on the sea,
     White flashes dance along the deep,
That moans as if uneasily
     It turned in an unquiet sleep.

Ridge after rocky ridge upheaves
     A toppling crest that falls in spray
Where the tormented beach receives
     The buffets of the sea's wild play.

On the horizon's nearing line,
     Where the sky rests, a visible wall.
Grey in the offing, I divine
     The sails that fly before the squall.
