THE train through the night of the town,
     Through a blackness broken in twain
          By the sudden finger of streets;
Lights, red, yellow, and brown,
     From curtain and window-pane,
          The flashing eyes of the streets.

Night, and the rush of the train,
     A cloud of smoke through the town,
          Scaring the life of the streets;
And the leap of the heart again,
     Out into the night, and down
          The dazzling vista of streets!
