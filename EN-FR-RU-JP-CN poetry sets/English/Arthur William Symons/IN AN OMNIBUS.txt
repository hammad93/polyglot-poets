YOUR smile is like a treachery,
     A treachery adorable;
So smiles the siren where the sea
     Sings to the unforgetting shell.

Your fleeting Leonardo face,
     Parisian Monna Lisa, dreams
     Elusively, but not of streams
Born in a shadow-haunted place.

Of Paris, Paris, is your thought,
     Of Paris robes, and when to wear
The latest bonnet you have bought
     To match the marvel of your hair.

Yet that fine malice of your smile,
     That faint and fluctuating glint
     Between your eyelids, does it hint
Alone of matters mercantile

Close lips that keep the secret in,
     Half spoken by the stealthy eyes,
Is there indeed no word to win,
     No secret, from the vague replies

Of lips and lids that feign to hide
     That which they feign to render up
     Is there, in Tantalus' dim cup,
The shadow of water, nought beside
