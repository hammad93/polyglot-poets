IF, Mary, that imperious face,
     And not in dreams alone,
Come to this shadow-haunted place
     And claim dominion;

If, for your sake, I do unqueen
     Some well-remembered ghost,
Forgetting much of what hath been
     Best loved, remembered most;

It is your witchery, not my will,
     Your beauty, not my choice
My shadows knew me faithful, till
     They heard your living voice.
