BENEATH the heaven of her brows'
     Unclouded noon of peace, there lies
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs
     In the seclusion of her eyes;

Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;
     And there's a little flame that dances
(A firefly in a grassy nest)
     In the green circle of her glances;

A frolic Faun that must be hid,
     Shyly, in some fantastic shade,
Where pity droops a tender lid
     On laughter of itself afraid.
