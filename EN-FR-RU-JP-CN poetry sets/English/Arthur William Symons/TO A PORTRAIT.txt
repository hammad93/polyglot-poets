A PENSIVE photograph
     Watches me from the shelf
Ghost of old love, and half
     Ghost of myself!

How the dear waiting eyes
     Watch me and love me yet
Sad home of memories,
     Her waiting eyes!

Ghost of old love, wronged ghost,
     Return, though all the pain
Of all once loved, long lost,
     Come back again.

Forget not, but forgive!
     Alas, too late I cry.
We are two ghosts that had their chance to live,
     And lost it, she and I.
