HER face's wilful flash and glow
     Turned all its light upon my face
     One bright delirious moment's space,
And then she passed I followed slow

Across the heath, and up and round,
     And watched the splendid death of day
     Upon the summits far away,
And in her fateful beauty found

The fierce wild beauty of the light
     That startles twilight on the hills,
     And lightens all the mountain rills,
And flames before the feet of night.
