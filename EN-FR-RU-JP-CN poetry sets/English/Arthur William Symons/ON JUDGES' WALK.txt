THAT night on Judges' Walk the wind
     Was as the voice of doom;
The heath, a lake of darkness, lay
     As silent as the tomb.

The vast night brooded, white with stars,
     Above the world's unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
     Like a strong heart repressed.

That night we walked beneath the trees,
     Alone, beneath the trees;
There was some word we could not say
     Half uttered in the breeze.

That night on Judges' Walk we said
     No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
     Before the Judge's Day.
