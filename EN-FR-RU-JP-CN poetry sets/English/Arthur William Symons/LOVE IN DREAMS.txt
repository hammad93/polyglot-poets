I LIE on my pallet bed,
     And I hear the drip of the rain;
The rain on my garret roof is falling,
     And I am cold and in pain.

I lie on my pallet bed,
     And my heart is wild with delight;
I hear her voice through the midnight calling,
     As I lie awake in the night.

I lie on my pallet bed,
     And I see her bright eyes gleam;
She smiles, she speaks, and the world is ended,
     And made again in a dream.
