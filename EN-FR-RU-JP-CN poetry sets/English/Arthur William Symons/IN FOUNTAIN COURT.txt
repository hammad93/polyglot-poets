THE fountain murmuring of sleep,
     A drowsy tune;
The flickering green of leaves that keep
     The light of June;
Peace, through a slumbering afternoon,
     The peace of June.

A waiting ghost, in the blue sky,
     The white curved moon;
June, hushed and breathless, waits, and I
     Wait too, with June;
Come, through the lingering afternoon,
     Soon, love, come soon.
