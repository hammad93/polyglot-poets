THE light of our cigarettes
     Went and came in the gloom
     It was dark in the little room.

Dark, and then, in the dark,
     Sudden, a flash, a glow,
     And a hand and a ring I know.

And then, through the dark, a flush
     Ruddy and vague, the grace--
     A rose--of her lyric face.
