I CHASE a shadow through the night,
     A shadow unavailing;
Out of the dark, into the light,
     I follow, follow is it she

Against the wall of sea outlined,
     Outlined against the windows lit,
The shadow flickers, and behind
     I follow, follow after it.

The shadow leads me through the night
     To the grey margin of the sea;
Out of the dark, into the light,
     I follow unavailingly.
