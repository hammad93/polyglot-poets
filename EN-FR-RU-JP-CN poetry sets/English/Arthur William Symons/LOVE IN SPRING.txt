GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then
     Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!
Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men
Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife.

Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid,
     Hearts on a holiday ho! let us love it is Spring.
Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,
     Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.

Well, but to-morrow To-morrow, good-bye it is over.
     Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met.
Tears What is this But I thought we were playing at lover.
     Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!
