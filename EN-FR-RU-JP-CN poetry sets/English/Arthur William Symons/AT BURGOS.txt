MIRACULOUS silver-work in stone
     Against the blue miraculous skies,
     The belfry towers and turrets rise
Out of the arches that enthrone
     That airy wonder of the skies.

Softly against the burning sun
     The great cathedral spreads its wings;
     High up, the lyric belfry sings.
Behold Ascension Day begun
     Under the shadow of those wings!
