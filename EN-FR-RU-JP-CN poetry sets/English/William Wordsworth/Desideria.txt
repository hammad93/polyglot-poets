SURPRISED by joy--impatient as the Wind 
   I turned to share the transport--O! with whom 
   But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb, 
That spot which no vicissitude can find? 
Love, faithful love, recall'd thee to my mind-- 
   But how could I forget thee? Through what power, 
   Even for the least division of an hour, 
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind 
To my most grievous loss?--That thought's return 
   Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, 
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn, 
   Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more; 
That neither present time, nor years unborn 
   Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.
