ENGLAND! the time is come when thou should'st wean
Thy heart from its emasculating food;
The truth should now be better understood;
Old things have been unsettled; we have seen
Fair seed-time, better harvest might have been
But for thy trespasses; and, at this day,
If for Greece, Egypt, India, Africa,
Aught good were destined, thou would'st step between.
England! all nations in this charge agree
But worse, more ignorant in love and hate,
Far--far more abject, is thine Enemy
Therefore the wise pray for thee, though the freight
Of thy offences be a heavy weight
Oh grief that Earth's best hopes rest all with Thee!
