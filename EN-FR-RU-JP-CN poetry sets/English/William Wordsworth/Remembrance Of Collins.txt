Glide gently, thus for ever glide, 
O Thames! that other bards may see 
As lovely visions by thy side 
As now, fair river! come to me. 
O glide, fair stream! for ever so, 
Thy quiet soul on all bestowing, 
Till all our minds for ever flow 
As thy deep waters now are flowing. 

Vain thought!--Yet be as now thou art, 
That in thy waters may be seen 
The image of a poet's heart, 
How bright, how solemn, how serene! 
Such as did once the Poet bless, 
Who murmuring here a later ditty, 
Could find no refuge from distress 
But in the milder grief of pity. 

Now let us, as we float along, 
For 'him' suspend the dashing oar; 
And pray that never child of song 
May know that Poet's sorrows more. 
How calm! how still! the only sound, 
The dripping of the oar suspended! 
--The evening darkness gathers round 
By virtue's holiest Powers attended.
