WHO fancied what a pretty sight
This Rock would be if edged around
With living snow-drops circlet bright!
How glorious to this orchard-ground!
Who loved the little Rock, and set
Upon its head this coronet
Was it the humour of a child
Or rather of some gentle maid,
Whose brows, the day that she was styled
The shepherd-queen, were thus arrayed
Of man mature, or matron sage
Or old man toying with his age!
I asked--'twas whispered; The device
To each and all might well belong
It is the Spirit of Paradise
That prompts such work, a Spirit strong,
That gives to all the self-same bent
Where life is wise and innocent.
