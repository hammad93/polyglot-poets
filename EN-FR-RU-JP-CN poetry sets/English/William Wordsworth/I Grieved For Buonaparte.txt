I GRIEVED for Buonaparte, with a vain
And an unthinking grief! The tenderest mood
Of that Man's mind--what can it be what food
Fed his first hopes what knowledge could 'he' gain
'Tis not in battles that from youth we train
The Governor who must be wise and good,
And temper with the sternness of the brain
Thoughts motherly, and meek as womanhood.
Wisdom doth live with children round her knees
Books, leisure, perfect freedom, and the talk
Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk
Of the mind's business these are the degrees
By which true Sway doth mount; this is the stalk
True Power doth grow on; and her rights are these.
