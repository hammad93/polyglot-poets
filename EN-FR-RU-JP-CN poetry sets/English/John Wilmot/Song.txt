Quoth the Duchess of Cleveland to counselor Knight,
I'd fain have a prick, knew I how to come by't.
I desire you'll be secret and give your advice
Though cunt be not coy, reputation is nice.

To some cellar in Sodom Your Grace must retire
Where porters with black-pots sit round a coal fire;
There open your case, and Your Grace cannot fail
Of a dozen of pricks for a dozen of ale.

Is't so quoth the Duchess. Aye, by God! quoth the whore.
Then give me the key that unlocks the back door,
For I'd rather be fucked by porters and carmen
Than thus be abused by Churchill and Jermyn.
