   THERE is a house with ivied walls,
   And mullioned windows worn and old,
   And the long dwellers in those halls
   Have souls that know but sordid calls,
      And daily dote on gold.

                                    

   In blazing brick and plated show
   Not far away a “villa” gleams,
   And here a family few may know,
   With book and pencil, viol and bow,
      Lead inner lives of dreams.

                                   

   The philosophic passers say,
   “See that old mansion mossed and fair,
   Poetic souls therein are they
   And O that gaudy box!  Away,
      You vulgar people there.”
