   IT bends far over Yell’ham Plain,
      And we, from Yell’ham Height,
   Stand and regard its fiery train,
      So soon to swim from sight.

                                   
   It will return long years hence, when
      As now its strange swift shine
   Will fall on Yell’ham; but not then
      On that sweet form of thine.
