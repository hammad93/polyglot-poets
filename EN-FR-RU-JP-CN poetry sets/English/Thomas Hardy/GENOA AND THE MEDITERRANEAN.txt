      O EPIC-FAMED, god-haunted Central Sea,
      Heave careless of the deep wrong done to thee
   When from Torino’s track I saw thy face first flash on me.

      And multimarbled Genova the Proud,
      Gleam all unconscious how, wide-lipped, up-browed,
   I first beheld thee clad—not as the Beauty but the Dowd.

      Out from a deep-delved way my vision lit
      On housebacks pink, green, ochreous—where a slit
   Shoreward ’twixt row and row revealed the classic blue through it.

      And thereacross waved fishwives’ high-hung smocks,
      Chrome kerchiefs, scarlet hose, darned underfrocks;
   Since when too oft my dreams of thee, O Queen, that frippery mocks

      Whereat I grieve, Superba! . . . Afterhours
      Within Palazzo Doria’s orange bowers
   Went far to mend these marrings of thy soul-subliming powers.

      But, Queen, such squalid undress none should see,
      Those dream-endangering eyewounds no more be
   Where lovers first behold thy form in pilgrimage to thee.
