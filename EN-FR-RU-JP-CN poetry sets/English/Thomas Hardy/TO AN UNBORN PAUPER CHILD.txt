      BREATHE not, hid Heart cease silently,
      And though thy birth-hour beckons thee,
         Sleep the long sleep
         The Doomsters heap
      Travails and teens around us here,
   And Time-wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.

                                    

      Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh,
      And laughters fail, and greetings die
         Hopes dwindle; yea,
         Faiths waste away,
      Affections and enthusiasms numb;
   Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

                                   

      Had I the ear of wombèd souls
      Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls,
         And thou wert free
         To cease, or be,
      Then would I tell thee all I know,
   And put it to thee Wilt thou take Life so

                                    

      Vain vow!  No hint of mine may hence
      To theeward fly to thy locked sense
         Explain none can
         Life’s pending plan
      Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make
   Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake.

                                    

      Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot
      Of earth’s wide wold for thee, where not
         One tear, one qualm,
         Should break the calm.
      But I am weak as thou and bare;
   No man can change the common lot to rare.

                                    

      Must come and bide.  And such are we—
      Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary—
         That I can hope
         Health, love, friends, scope
      In full for thee; can dream thou’lt find
   Joys seldom yet attained by humankind!
