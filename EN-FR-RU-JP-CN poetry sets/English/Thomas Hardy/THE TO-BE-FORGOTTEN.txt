      I HEARD a small sad sound,
   And stood awhile amid the tombs around
   “Wherefore, old friends,” said I, “are ye distrest,
      Now, screened from life’s unrest”

                                    

      —“O not at being here;
   But that our future second death is drear;
   When, with the living, memory of us numbs,
      And blank oblivion comes!

                                   

      “Those who our grandsires be
   Lie here embraced by deeper death than we;
   Nor shape nor thought of theirs canst thou descry
      With keenest backward eye.

                                    

      “They bide as quite forgot;
   They are as men who have existed not;
   Theirs is a loss past loss of fitful breath;
      It is the second death.

                                    

      “We here, as yet, each day
   Are blest with dear recall; as yet, alway
   In some soul hold a loved continuance
      Of shape and voice and glance.

                                    

      “But what has been will be—
   First memory, then oblivion’s turbid sea;
   Like men foregone, shall we merge into those
      Whose story no one knows.

                                   

      “For which of us could hope
   To show in life that world-awakening scope
   Granted the few whose memory none lets die,
      But all men magnify

                                   

      “We were but Fortune’s sport;
   Things true, things lovely, things of good report
   We neither shunned nor sought . . . We see our bourne,
      And seeing it we mourn.”
