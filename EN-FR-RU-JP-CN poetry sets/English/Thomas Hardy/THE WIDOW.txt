   BY Mellstock Lodge and Avenue
      Towards her door I went,
   And sunset on her window-panes
      Reflected our intent.

   The creeper on the gable nigh
      Was fired to more than red
   And when I came to halt thereby
      “Bright as my joy!” I said.

   Of late days it had been her aim
      To meet me in the hall;
   Now at my footsteps no one came;
      And no one to my call.

   Again I knocked; and tardily
      An inner step was heard,
   And I was shown her presence then
      With scarce an answering word.

   She met me, and but barely took
      My proffered warm embrace;
   Preoccupation weighed her look,
      And hardened her sweet face.

   “To-morrow—could you—would you call
      Make brief your present stay
   My child is ill—my one, my all!—
      And can’t be left to-day.”

   And then she turns, and gives commands
      As I were out of sound,
   Or were no more to her and hers
      Than any neighbour round . . .

   —As maid I wooed her; but one came
      And coaxed her heart away,
   And when in time he wedded her
      I deemed her gone for aye.

   He won, I lost her; and my loss
      I bore I know not how;
   But I do think I suffered then
      Less wretchedness than now.

   For Time, in taking him, had oped
      An unexpected door
   Of bliss for me, which grew to seem
      Far surer than before . . .

   Her word is steadfast, and I know
      That plighted firm are we
   But she has caught new love-calls since
      She smiled as maid on me!
