   WHEN the hamlet hailed a birth
      Judy used to cry
   When she heard our christening mirth
      She would kneel and sigh.
   She was crazed, we knew, and we
   Humoured her infirmity.

   When the daughters and the sons
      Gathered them to wed,
   And we like-intending ones
      Danced till dawn was red,
   She would rock and mutter, “More
   Comers to this stony shore!”

   When old Headsman Death laid hands
      On a babe or twain,
   She would feast, and by her brands
      Sing her songs again.
   What she liked we let her do,
   Judy was insane, we knew.
