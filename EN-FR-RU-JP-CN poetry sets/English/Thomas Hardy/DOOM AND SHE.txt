      THERE dwells a mighty pair—
      Slow, statuesque, intense—
      Amid the vague Immense
   None can their chronicle declare,
      Nor why they be, nor whence.

                                    

      Mother of all things made,
      Matchless in artistry,
      Unlit with sight is she.—
   And though her ever well-obeyed
      Vacant of feeling he.

                                   

      The Matron mildly asks—
      A throb in every word—
      “Our clay-made creatures, lord,
   How fare they in their mortal tasks
      Upon Earth’s bounded bord

                                    

      “The fate of those I bear,
      Dear lord, pray turn and view,
      And notify me true;
   Shapings that eyelessly I dare
      Maybe I would undo.

                                    

      “Sometimes from lairs of life
      Methinks I catch a groan,
      Or multitudinous moan,
   As though I had schemed a world of strife,
      Working by touch alone.”

                                    

      “World-weaver!” he replies,
      “I scan all thy domain;
      But since nor joy nor pain
   Doth my clear substance recognize,
      I read thy realms in vain.

                                   

      “World-weaver! what _is_ Grief
      And what are Right, and Wrong,
      And Feeling, that belong
   To creatures all who owe thee fief
      What worse is Weak than Strong” . . .

                                   

      —Unlightened, curious, meek,
      She broods in sad surmise . . .
      —Some say they have heard her sighs
   On Alpine height or Polar peak
      When the night tempests rise.
