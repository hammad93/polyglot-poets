   A SHADED lamp and a waving blind,
   And the beat of a clock from a distant floor
   On this scene enter—winged, horned, and spined—
   A longlegs, a moth, and a dumbledore;
   While ’mid my page there idly stands
   A sleepy fly, that rubs its hands . . .


   Thus meet we five, in this still place,
   At this point of time, at this point in space.
   —My guests parade my new-penned ink,
   Or bang at the lamp-glass, whirl, and sink.
   “God’s humblest, they!” I muse.  Yet why
   They know Earth-secrets that know not I.
