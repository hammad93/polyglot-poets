         I SAID to Love,
   “It is not now as in old days
   When men adored thee and thy ways
         All else above;
   Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One
   Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,”
         I said to Love.

         I said to him,
   “We now know more of thee than then;
   We were but weak in judgment when,
         With hearts abrim,
   We clamoured thee that thou would’st please
   Inflict on us thine agonies,”
         I said to him.

         I said to Love,
   “Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
   No faery darts, no cherub air,
         Nor swan, nor dove
   Are thine; but features pitiless,
   And iron daggers of distress,”
         I said to Love.

         “Depart then, Love! . . .
   —Man’s race shall end, dost threaten thou
   The age to come the man of now
         Know nothing of—
   We fear not such a threat from thee;
   We are too old in apathy!
   _Mankind shall cease_.—So let it be,”
         I said to Love.
