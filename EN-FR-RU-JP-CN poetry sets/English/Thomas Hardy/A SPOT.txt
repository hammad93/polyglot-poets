      IN years defaced and lost,
      Two sat here, transport-tossed,
      Lit by a living love
   The wilted world knew nothing of
         Scared momently
         By gaingivings,
         Then hoping things
         That could not be.

      Of love and us no trace
      Abides upon the place;
      The sun and shadows wheel,
   Season and season sereward steal;
         Foul days and fair
         Here, too, prevail,
         And gust and gale
         As everywhere.

      But lonely shepherd souls
      Who bask amid these knolls
      May catch a faery sound
   On sleepy noontides from the ground
         “O not again
         Till Earth outwears
         Shall love like theirs
         Suffuse this glen!”
