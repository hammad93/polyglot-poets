   “O PASSENGER, pray list and catch
      Our sighs and piteous groans,
   Half stifled in this jumbled patch
      Of wrenched memorial stones!

   “We late-lamented, resting here,
      Are mixed to human jam,
   And each to each exclaims in fear,
      ‘I know not which I am!’

   “The wicked people have annexed
      The verses on the good;
   A roaring drunkard sports the text
      Teetotal Tommy should!

   “Where we are huddled none can trace,
      And if our names remain,
   They pave some path or p-ing place
      Where we have never lain!

   “There’s not a modest maiden elf
      But dreads the final Trumpet,
   Lest half of her should rise herself,
      And half some local strumpet!

   “From restorations of Thy fane,
      From smoothings of Thy sward,
   From zealous Churchmen’s pick and plane
      Deliver us O Lord!  Amen!”
