   I TRAVERSED a dominion
   Whose spokesmen spake out strong
   Their purpose and opinion
   Through pulpit, press, and song.
   I scarce had means to note there
   A large-eyed few, and dumb,
   Who thought not as those thought there
   That stirred the heat and hum.

                                   

   When, grown a Shade, beholding
   That land in lifetime trode,
   To learn if its unfolding
   Fulfilled its clamoured code,
   I saw, in web unbroken,
   Its history outwrought
   Not as the loud had spoken,
   But as the mute had thought.
