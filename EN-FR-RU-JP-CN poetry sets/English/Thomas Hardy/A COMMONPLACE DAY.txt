      THE day is turning ghost,
   And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively,
      To join the anonymous host
   Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe,
      To one of like degree.

      I part the fire-gnawed logs,
   Rake forth the embers, spoil the busy flames, and lay the ends
      Upon the shining dogs;
   Further and further from the nooks the twilight’s stride extends,
      And beamless black impends.

      Nothing of tiniest worth
   Have I wrought, pondered, planned; no one thing asking blame or
   praise,
      Since the pale corpse-like birth
   Of this diurnal unit, bearing blanks in all its rays—
      Dullest of dull-hued Days!

      Wanly upon the panes
   The rain slides as have slid since morn my colourless thoughts; and
   yet
      Here, while Day’s presence wanes,
   And over him the sepulchre-lid is slowly lowered and set,
      He wakens my regret.

      Regret—though nothing dear
   That I wot of, was toward in the wide world at his prime,
      Or bloomed elsewhere than here,
   To die with his decease, and leave a memory sweet, sublime,
      Or mark him out in Time . . .

      —Yet, maybe, in some soul,
   In some spot undiscerned on sea or land, some impulse rose,
      Or some intent upstole
   Of that enkindling ardency from whose maturer glows
      The world’s amendment flows;

      But which, benumbed at birth
   By momentary chance or wile, has missed its hope to be
      Embodied on the earth;
   And undervoicings of this loss to man’s futurity
      May wake regret in me.
