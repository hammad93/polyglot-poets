         A SPIRIT seems to pass,
      Formal in pose, but grave and grand withal
      He contemplates a volume stout and tall,
   And far lamps fleck him through the thin acacias.

         Anon the book is closed,
      With “It is finished!”  And at the alley’s end
      He turns, and soon on me his glances bend;
   And, as from earth, comes speech—small, muted, yet composed.

         “How fares the Truth now—Ill
      —Do pens but slily further her advance
      May one not speed her but in phrase askance
   Do scribes aver the Comic to be Reverend still

         “Still rule those minds on earth
      At whom sage Milton’s wormwood words were hurled
      ‘_Truth like a bastard comes into the world_
   _Never without ill-fame to him who gives her birth_’”
