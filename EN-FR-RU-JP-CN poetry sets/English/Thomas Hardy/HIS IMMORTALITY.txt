      I SAW a dead man’s finer part
   Shining within each faithful heart
   Of those bereft.  Then said I “This must be
         His immortality.”

                                    

      I looked there as the seasons wore,
   And still his soul continuously upbore
   Its life in theirs.  But less its shine excelled
         Than when I first beheld.

                                   

      His fellow-yearsmen passed, and then
   In later hearts I looked for him again;
   And found him—shrunk, alas! into a thin
         And spectral mannikin.

                                    

      Lastly I ask—now old and chill—
   If aught of him remain unperished still;
   And find, in me alone, a feeble spark,
         Dying amid the dark.
