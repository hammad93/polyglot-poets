   SHE sits in the tawny vapour
         That the City lanes have uprolled,
         Behind whose webby fold on fold
   Like a waning taper
      The street-lamp glimmers cold.

   A messenger’s knock cracks smartly,
         Flashed news is in her hand
         Of meaning it dazes to understand
   Though shaped so shortly
      _He—has fallen—in the far South Land_ . . .

                            

   ’Tis the morrow; the fog hangs thicker,
         The postman nears and goes
         A letter is brought whose lines disclose
   By the firelight flicker
      His hand, whom the worm now knows

   Fresh—firm—penned in highest feather—
         Page-full of his hoped return,
         And of home-planned jaunts by brake and burn
   In the summer weather,
      And of new love that they would learn.
