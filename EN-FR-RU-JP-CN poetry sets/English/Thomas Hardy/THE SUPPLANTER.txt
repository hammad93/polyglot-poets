   HE bends his travel-tarnished feet
      To where she wastes in clay
   From day-dawn until eve he fares
      Along the wintry way;
   From day-dawn until eve repairs
      Unto her mound to pray.


   “Are these the gravestone shapes that meet
      My forward-straining view
   Or forms that cross a window-blind
      In circle, knot, and queue
   Gay forms, that cross and whirl and wind
      To music throbbing through”—


   “The Keeper of the Field of Tombs
      Dwells by its gateway-pier;
   He celebrates with feast and dance
      His daughter’s twentieth year
   He celebrates with wine of France
      The birthday of his dear.”—

                                 
   “The gates are shut when evening glooms
      Lay down your wreath, sad wight;
   To-morrow is a time more fit
      For placing flowers aright
   The morning is the time for it;
      Come, wake with us to-night!”—

                                
   He grounds his wreath, and enters in,
      And sits, and shares their cheer.—
   “I fain would foot with you, young man,
      Before all others here;
   I fain would foot it for a span
      With such a cavalier!”

                                
   She coaxes, clasps, nor fails to win
      His first-unwilling hand
   The merry music strikes its staves,
      The dancers quickly band;
   And with the damsel of the graves
      He duly takes his stand.


   “You dance divinely, stranger swain,
      Such grace I’ve never known.
   O longer stay!  Breathe not adieu
      And leave me here alone!
   O longer stay to her be true
      Whose heart is all your own!”—


   “I mark a phantom through the pane,
      That beckons in despair,
   Its mouth all drawn with heavy moan—
      Her to whom once I sware!”—
   “Nay; ’tis the lately carven stone
      Of some strange girl laid there!”—

                                    

   “I see white flowers upon the floor
      Betrodden to a clot;
   My wreath were they”—“Nay; love me much,
      Swear you’ll forget me not!
   ’Twas but a wreath!  Full many such
      Are brought here and forgot.”   


   The watches of the night grow hoar,
      He rises ere the sun;
   “Now could I kill thee here!” he says,
      “For winning me from one
   Who ever in her living days
      Was pure as cloistered nun!”

                                 
   She cowers, and he takes his track
      Afar for many a mile,
   For evermore to be apart
      From her who could beguile
   His senses by her burning heart,
      And win his love awhile.


   A year: and he is travelling back
      To her who wastes in clay;
   From day-dawn until eve he fares
      Along the wintry way,
   From day-dawn until eve repairs
      Unto her mound to pray.


   And there he sets him to fulfil
      His frustrate first intent:
   And lay upon her bed, at last,
      The offering earlier meant:
   When, on his stooping figure, ghast
      And haggard eyes are bent.

                                  

   “O surely for a little while
      You can be kind to me!
   For do you love her, do you hate,
      She knows not—cares not she:
   Only the living feel the weight
      Of loveless misery!

                                    

   “I own my sin; I’ve paid its cost,
      Being outcast, shamed, and bare:
   I give you daily my whole heart,
      Your babe my tender care,
   I pour you prayers; and aye to part
      Is more than I can bear!”

                                   

   He turns—unpitying, passion-tossed;
      “I know you not!” he cries,
   “Nor know your child.  I knew this maid,
      But she’s in Paradise!”
   And swiftly in the winter shade
      He breaks from her and flies.
