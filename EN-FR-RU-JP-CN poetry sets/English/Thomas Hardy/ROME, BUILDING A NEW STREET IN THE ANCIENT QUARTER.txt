   THESE numbered cliffs and gnarls of masonry
   Outskeleton Time’s central city, Rome;
   Whereof each arch, entablature, and dome
   Lies bare in all its gaunt anatomy.

   And cracking frieze and rotten metope
   Express, as though they were an open tome
   Top-lined with caustic monitory gnome;
   “Dunces, Learn here to spell Humanity!”

   And yet within these ruins’ very shade
   The singing workmen shape and set and join
   Their frail new mansion’s stuccoed cove and quoin
   With no apparent sense that years abrade,
   Though each rent wall their feeble works invade
   Once shamed all such in power of pier and groin.
