   I HAVE lived with shades so long,
   And talked to them so oft,
   Since forth from cot and croft
   I went mankind among,
      That sometimes they
      In their dim style
      Will pause awhile
      To hear my say;

                                    

   And take me by the hand,
   And lead me through their rooms
   In the To-be, where Dooms
   Half-wove and shapeless stand
      And show from there
      The dwindled dust
      And rot and rust
      Of things that were.

                                   

   “Now turn,” spake they to me
   One day “Look whence we came,
   And signify his name
   Who gazes thence at thee.”—
      —“Nor name nor race
      Know I, or can,”
      I said, “Of man
      So commonplace.

                                    

   “He moves me not at all;
   I note no ray or jot
   Of rareness in his lot,
   Or star exceptional.
      Into the dim
      Dead throngs around
      He’ll sink, nor sound
      Be left of him.”

                                    

   “Yet,” said they, “his frail speech,
   Hath accents pitched like thine—
   Thy mould and his define
   A likeness each to each—
      But go!  Deep pain
      Alas, would be
      His name to thee,
      And told in vain!”
