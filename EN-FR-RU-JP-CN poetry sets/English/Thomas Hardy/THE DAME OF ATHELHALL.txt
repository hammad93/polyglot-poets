   “SOUL!  Shall I see thy face,” she said,
      “In one brief hour
   And away with thee from a loveless bed
   To a far-off sun, to a vine-wrapt bower,
   And be thine own unseparated,
      And challenge the world’s white glower”

                                    

   She quickened her feet, and met him where
      They had predesigned
   And they clasped, and mounted, and cleft the air
   Upon whirling wheels; till the will to bind
   Her life with his made the moments there
      Efface the years behind.

                                   

   Miles slid, and the sight of the port upgrew
      As they sped on;
   When slipping its bond the bracelet flew
   From her fondled arm.  Replaced anon,
   Its cameo of the abjured one drew
      Her musings thereupon.

                                    

   The gaud with his image once had been
      A gift from him
   And so it was that its carving keen
   Refurbished memories wearing dim,
   Which set in her soul a throe of teen,
      And a tear on her lashes’ brim.

                                    

   “I may not go!” she at length upspake,
      “Thoughts call me back—
   I would still lose all for your dear, dear sake;
   My heart is thine, friend!  But my track
   I home to Athelhall must take
      To hinder household wrack!”

                                    

   He appealed.  But they parted, weak and wan
      And he left the shore;
   His ship diminished, was low, was gone;
   And she heard in the waves as the daytide wore,
   And read in the leer of the sun that shone,
      That they parted for evermore.

                                   

   She homed as she came, at the dip of eve
      On Athel Coomb
   Regaining the Hall she had sworn to leave . . .
   The house was soundless as a tomb,
   And she entered her chamber, there to grieve
      Lone, kneeling, in the gloom.

                                   

   From the lawn without rose her husband’s voice
      To one his friend
   “Another her Love, another my choice,
   Her going is good.  Our conditions mend;
   In a change of mates we shall both rejoice;
      I hoped that it thus might end!

                                    

   “A quick divorce; she will make him hers,
      And I wed mine.
   So Time rights all things in long, long years—
   Or rather she, by her bold design!
   I admire a woman no balk deters
      She has blessed my life, in fine.

                                   

   “I shall build new rooms for my new true bride,
      Let the bygone be
   By now, no doubt, she has crossed the tide
   With the man to her mind.  Far happier she
   In some warm vineland by his side
      Than ever she was with me.”
