   SIRMIO, thou dearest dear of strands
   That Neptune strokes in lake and sea,
   With what high joy from stranger lands
   Doth thy old friend set foot on thee!
   Yea, barely seems it true to me
   That no Bithynia holds me now,
   But calmly and assuringly
   Around me stretchest homely Thou.

   Is there a scene more sweet than when
   Our clinging cares are undercast,
   And, worn by alien moils and men,
   The long untrodden sill repassed,
   We press the pined for couch at last,
   And find a full repayment there
   Then hail, sweet Sirmio; thou that wast,
   And art, mine own unrivalled Fair!
