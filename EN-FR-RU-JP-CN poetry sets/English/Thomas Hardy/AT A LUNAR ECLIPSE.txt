   THY shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea,
   Now steals along upon the Moon’s meek shine
   In even monochrome and curving line
   Of imperturbable serenity.

   How shall I link such sun-cast symmetry
   With the torn troubled form I know as thine,
   That profile, placid as a brow divine,
   With continents of moil and misery

   And can immense Mortality but throw
   So small a shade, and Heaven’s high human scheme
   Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies

   Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show,
   Nation at war with nation, brains that teem,
   Heroes, and women fairer than the skies
