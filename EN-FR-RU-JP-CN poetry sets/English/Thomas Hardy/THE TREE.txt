   Its roots are bristling in the air
   Like some mad Earth-god’s spiny hair;
   The loud south-wester’s swell and yell
   Smote it at midnight, and it fell.
      Thus ends the tree
      Where Some One sat with me.

                                    

   Its boughs, which none but darers trod,
   A child may step on from the sod,
   And twigs that earliest met the dawn
   Are lit the last upon the lawn.
      Cart off the tree
      Beneath whose trunk sat we!

                                   

   Yes, there we sat she cooed content,
   And bats ringed round, and daylight went;
   The gnarl, our seat, is wrenched and sunk,
   Prone that queer pocket in the trunk
      Where lay the key
      To her pale mystery.

                                    

   “Years back, within this pocket-hole
   I found, my Love, a hurried scrawl
   Meant not for me,” at length said I;
   “I glanced thereat, and let it lie
      The words were three—
      ‘_Beloved_, _I agree_.’

                                    

   “Who placed it here; to what request
   It gave assent, I never guessed.
   Some prayer of some hot heart, no doubt,
   To some coy maiden hereabout,
      Just as, maybe,
      With you, Sweet Heart, and me.”

                                    

   She waited, till with quickened breath
   She spoke, as one who banisheth
   Reserves that lovecraft heeds so well,
   To ease some mighty wish to tell
      “’Twas I,” said she,
      “Who wrote thus clinchingly.

                                   

   “My lover’s wife—aye, wife!—knew nought
   Of what we felt, and bore, and thought . . .
   He’d said ‘_I wed with thee or die_
   _She stands between_, ’_tis true_.  _But why_
      _Do thou agree_,
      _And—she shalt cease to be_.’

                                   

   “How I held back, how love supreme
   Involved me madly in his scheme
   Why should I say . . . I wrote assent
    to his intent . . .
      She—_died_ . . . But he
      Came not to wed with me.

                                    

   “O shrink not, Love!—Had these eyes seen
   But once thine own, such had not been!
   But we were strangers . . . Thus the plot
   Cleared passion’s path.—Why came he not
      To wed with me . . .
      He wived the gibbet-tree.”

                                    

   —Under that oak of heretofore
   Sat Sweetheart mine with me no more
   By many a Fiord, and Strom, and Fleuve
   Have I since wandered . . . Soon, for love,
      Distraught went she—
      ’Twas said for love of me.
