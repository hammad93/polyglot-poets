   I NEED not go
   Through sleet and snow
   To where I know
   She waits for me;
   She will wait me there
   Till I find it fair,
   And have time to spare
   From company.

   When I’ve overgot
   The world somewhat,
   When things cost not
   Such stress and strain,
   Is soon enough
   By cypress sough
   To tell my Love
   I am come again.

   And if some day,
   When none cries nay,
   I still delay
   To seek her side,
   (Though ample measure
   Of fitting leisure
   Await my pleasure)
   She will riot chide.

   What—not upbraid me
   That I delayed me,
   Nor ask what stayed me
   So long  Ah, no!—
   New cares may claim me,
   New loves inflame me,
   She will not blame me,
   But suffer it so.
