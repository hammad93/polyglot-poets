   I TRACED the Circus whose gray stones incline
   Where Rome and dim Etruria interjoin,
   Till came a child who showed an ancient coin
   That bore the image of a Constantine.

   She lightly passed; nor did she once opine
   How, better than all books, she had raised for me
   In swift perspective Europe’s history
   Through the vast years of Cæsar’s sceptred line.

   For in my distant plot of English loam
   ’Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find
   Coins of like impress.  As with one half blind
   Whom common simples cure, her act flashed home
   In that mute moment to my opened mind
   The power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome.
