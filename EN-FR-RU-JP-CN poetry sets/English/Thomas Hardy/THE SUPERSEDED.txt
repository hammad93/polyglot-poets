   AS newer comers crowd the fore,
      We drop behind.
   —We who have laboured long and sore
      Times out of mind,
   And keen are yet, must not regret
      To drop behind.

                                    

   Yet there are of us some who grieve
      To go behind;
   Staunch, strenuous souls who scarce believe
      Their fires declined,
   And know none cares, remembers, spares
      Who go behind.

                                   

   ’Tis not that we have unforetold
      The drop behind;
   We feel the new must oust the old
      In every kind;
   But yet we think, must we, must _we_,
      Too, drop behind
