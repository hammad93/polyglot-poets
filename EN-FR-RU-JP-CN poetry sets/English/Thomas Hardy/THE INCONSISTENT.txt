   I SAY, “She was as good as fair,”
      When standing by her mound;
   “Such passing sweetness,” I declare,
      “No longer treads the ground.”
   I say, “What living Love can catch
      Her bloom and bonhomie,
   And what in newer maidens match
      Her olden warmth to me!”

   —There stands within yon vestry-nook
      Where bonded lovers sign,
   Her name upon a faded book
      With one that is not mine.
   To him she breathed the tender vow
      She once had breathed to me,
   But yet I say, “O love, even now
      Would I had died for thee!”
