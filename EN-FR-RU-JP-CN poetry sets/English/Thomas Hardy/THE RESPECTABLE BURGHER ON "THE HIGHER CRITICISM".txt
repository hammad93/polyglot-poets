   SINCE Reverend Doctors now declare
   That clerks and people must prepare
   To doubt if Adam ever were;
   To hold the flood a local scare;
   To argue, though the stolid stare,
   That everything had happened ere
   The prophets to its happening sware;
   That David was no giant-slayer,
   Nor one to call a God-obeyer
   In certain details we could spare,
   But rather was a debonair
   Shrewd bandit, skilled as banjo-player
   That Solomon sang the fleshly Fair,
   And gave the Church no thought whate’er;
   That Esther with her royal wear,
   And Mordecai, the son of Jair,
   And Joshua’s triumphs, Job’s despair,
   And Balaam’s ass’s bitter blare;
   Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace-flare,
   And Daniel and the den affair,
   And other stories rich and rare,
   Were writ to make old doctrine wear
   Something of a romantic air
   That the Nain widow’s only heir,
   And Lazarus with cadaverous glare
   
   Did not return from Sheol’s lair
   That Jael set a fiendish snare,
   That Pontius Pilate acted square,
   That never a sword cut Malchus’ ear
   And 
   That — — did not reappear! . . .
   —Since thus they hint, nor turn a hair,
   All churchgoing will I forswear,
   And sit on Sundays in my chair,
   And read that moderate man Voltaire.
