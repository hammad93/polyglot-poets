   SOMEWHERE afield here something lies
   In Earth’s oblivious eyeless trust
   That moved a poet to prophecies—
   A pinch of unseen, unguarded dust

   The dust of the lark that Shelley heard,
   And made immortal through times to be;—
   Though it only lived like another bird,
   And knew not its immortality.

   Lived its meek life; then, one day, fell—
   A little ball of feather and bone;
   And how it perished, when piped farewell,
   And where it wastes, are alike unknown.

   Maybe it rests in the loam I view,
   Maybe it throbs in a myrtle’s green,
   Maybe it sleeps in the coming hue
   Of a grape on the slopes of yon inland scene.

   Go find it, faeries, go and find
   That tiny pinch of priceless dust,
   And bring a casket silver-lined,
   And framed of gold that gems encrust;

   And we will lay it safe therein,
   And consecrate it to endless time;
   For it inspired a bard to win
   Ecstatic heights in thought and rhyme.
