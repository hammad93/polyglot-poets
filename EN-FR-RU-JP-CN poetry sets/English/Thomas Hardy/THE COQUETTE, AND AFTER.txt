   FOR long the cruel wish I knew
   That your free heart should ache for me
   While mine should bear no ache for you;
   For, long—the cruel wish!—I knew
   How men can feel, and craved to view
   My triumph—fated not to be
   For long! . . . The cruel wish I knew
   That your free heart should ache for me!

                                    

   At last one pays the penalty—
   The woman—women always do.
   My farce, I found, was tragedy
   At last!—One pays the penalty
   With interest when one, fancy-free,
   Learns love, learns shame . . . Of sinners two
   At last _one_ pays the penalty—
   The woman—women always do!
