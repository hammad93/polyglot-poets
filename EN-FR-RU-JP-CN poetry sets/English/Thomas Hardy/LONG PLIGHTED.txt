         IS it worth while, dear, now,
   To call for bells, and sally forth arrayed
   For marriage-rites—discussed, decried, delayed
            So many years

         Is it worth while, dear, now,
   To stir desire for old fond purposings,
   By feints that Time still serves for dallyings,
            Though quittance nears

         Is it worth while, dear, when
   The day being so far spent, so low the sun,
   The undone thing will soon be as the done,
         And smiles as tears

         Is it worth while, dear, when
   Our cheeks are worn, our early brown is gray;
   When, meet or part we, none says yea or nay,
         Or heeds, or cares

         Is it worth while, dear, since
   We still can climb old Yell’ham’s wooded mounds
   Together, as each season steals its rounds
         And disappears

         Is it worth while, dear, since
   As mates in Mellstock churchyard we can lie,
   Till the last crash of all things low and high
         Shall end the spheres
