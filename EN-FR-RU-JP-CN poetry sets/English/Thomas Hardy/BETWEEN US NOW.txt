   BETWEEN us now and here—
      Two thrown together
   Who are not wont to wear
      Life’s flushest feather—
   Who see the scenes slide past,
   The daytimes dimming fast,
   Let there be truth at last,
      Even if despair.

   So thoroughly and long
      Have you now known me,
   So real in faith and strong
      Have I now shown me,
   That nothing needs disguise
   Further in any wise,
   Or asks or justifies
      A guarded tongue.

   Face unto face, then, say,
      Eyes mine own meeting,
   Is your heart far away,
      Or with mine beating
   When false things are brought low,
   And swift things have grown slow,
   Feigning like froth shall go,
      Faith be for aye.
