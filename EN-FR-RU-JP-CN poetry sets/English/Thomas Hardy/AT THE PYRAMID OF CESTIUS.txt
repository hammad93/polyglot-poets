         WHO, then, was Cestius,
         And what is he to me—
   Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous
         One thought alone brings he.

         I can recall no word
         Of anything he did;
   For me he is a man who died and was interred
         To leave a pyramid

         Whose purpose was exprest
         Not with its first design,
   Nor till, far down in Time, beside it found their rest
         Two countrymen of mine.

         Cestius in life, maybe,
         Slew, breathed out threatening;
   I know not.  This I know in death all silently
         He does a kindlier thing,

         In beckoning pilgrim feet
         With marble finger high
   To where, by shadowy wall and history-haunted street,
         Those matchless singers lie . . .

         —Say, then, he lived and died
         That stones which bear his name
   Should mark, through Time, where two immortal Shades abide;
         It is an ample fame.
