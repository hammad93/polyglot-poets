      BROTHER Bulleys, let us sing
      From the dawn till evening!—
   For we know not that we go not
      When the day’s pale pinions fold
      Unto those who sang of old.

      When I flew to Blackmoor Vale,
      Whence the green-gowned faeries hail,
   Roosting near them I could hear them
      Speak of queenly Nature’s ways,
      Means, and moods,—well known to fays.

      All we creatures, nigh and far
      , the Mother’s are
   Yet she never shows endeavour
      To protect from warrings wild
      Bird or beast she calls her child.

      Busy in her handsome house
      Known as Space, she falls a-drowse;
   Yet, in seeming, works on dreaming,
      While beneath her groping hands
      Fiends make havoc in her bands.

      How her hussif’ry succeeds
      She unknows or she unheeds,
   All things making for Death’s taking!
      —So the green-gowned faeries say
      Living over Blackmoor way.

      Come then, brethren, let us sing,
      From the dawn till evening!—
   For we know not that we go not
      When the day’s pale pinions fold
      Unto those who sang of old.
