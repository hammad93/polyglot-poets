   I SCANNED her picture dreaming,
      Till each dear line and hue
   Was imaged, to my seeming,
      As if it lived anew.

   Her lips began to borrow
      Their former wondrous smile;
   Her fair eyes, faint with sorrow,
      Grew sparkling as erstwhile.

   Such tears as often ran not
      Ran then, my love, for thee;
   And O, believe I cannot
      That thou are lost to me!
