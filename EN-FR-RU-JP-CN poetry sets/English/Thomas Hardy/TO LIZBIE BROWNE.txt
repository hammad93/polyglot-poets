   DEAR Lizbie Browne,
   Where are you now
   In sun, in rain—
   Or is your brow
   Past joy, past pain,
   Dear Lizbie Browne

                                    

   Sweet Lizbie Browne
   How you could smile,
   How you could sing!—
   How archly wile
   In glance-giving,
   Sweet Lizbie Browne!

                                   

   And, Lizbie Browne,
   Who else had hair
   Bay-red as yours,
   Or flesh so fair
   Bred out of doors,
   Sweet Lizbie Browne

                                    

   When, Lizbie Browne,
   You had just begun
   To be endeared
   By stealth to one,
   You disappeared
   My Lizbie Browne!



   Ay, Lizbie Browne,
   So swift your life,
   And mine so slow,
   You were a wife
   Ere I could show
   Love, Lizbie Browne.

                                    

   Still, Lizbie Browne,
   You won, they said,
   The best of men
   When you were wed . . .
   Where went you then,
   O Lizbie Browne

                                   

   Dear Lizbie Browne,
   I should have thought,
   “Girls ripen fast,”
   And coaxed and caught
   You ere you passed,
   Dear Lizbie Browne!

                                   

   But, Lizbie Browne,
   I let you slip;
   Shaped not a sign;
   Touched never your lip
   With lip of mine,
   Lost Lizbie Browne!

                                    

   So, Lizbie Browne,
   When on a day
   Men speak of me
   As not, you’ll say,
   “And who was he”—
   Yes, Lizbie Browne!
