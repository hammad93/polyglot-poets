   THE church flings forth a battled shade
      Over the moon-blanched sward;
   The church; my gift; whereto I paid
      My all in hand and hoard
         Lavished my gains
         With stintless pains
      To glorify the Lord.

                                  
   I squared the broad foundations in
      Of ashlared masonry;
   I moulded mullions thick and thin,
      Hewed fillet and ogee;
         I circleted
         Each sculptured head
      With nimb and canopy.

                                

   I called in many a craftsmaster
      To fix emblazoned glass,
   To figure Cross and Sepulchre
      On dossal, boss, and brass.
         My gold all spent,
         My jewels went
      To gem the cups of Mass.


   I borrowed deep to carve the screen
      And raise the ivoried Rood;
   I parted with my small demesne
      To make my owings good.
         Heir-looms unpriced
         I sacrificed,
      Until debt-free I stood.


   So closed the task.  “Deathless the Creed
      Here substanced!” said my soul
   “I heard me bidden to this deed,
      And straight obeyed the call.
         Illume this fane,
         That not in vain
      I build it, Lord of all!”

                                   

   But, as it chanced me, then and there
      Did dire misfortunes burst;
   My home went waste for lack of care,
      My sons rebelled and curst;
         Till I confessed
         That aims the best
      Were looking like the worst.


   Enkindled by my votive work
      No burning faith I find;
   The deeper thinkers sneer and smirk,
      And give my toil no mind;
         From nod and wink
         I read they think
      That I am fool and blind.

                                   

   My gift to God seems futile, quite;
      The world moves as erstwhile;
   And powerful wrong on feeble right
      Tramples in olden style.
         My faith burns down,
         I see no crown;
      But Cares, and Griefs, and Guile.


   So now, the remedy  Yea, this
      I gently swing the door
   Here, of my fane—no soul to wis—
      And cross the patterned floor
         To the rood-screen
         That stands between
      The nave and inner chore.

                                   

   The rich red windows dim the moon,
      But little light need I;
   I mount the prie-dieu, lately hewn
      From woods of rarest dye;
         Then from below
         My garment, so,
      I draw this cord, and tie

                                    

   One end thereof around the beam
      Midway ’twixt Cross and truss
   I noose the nethermost extreme,
      And in ten seconds thus
         I journey hence—
         To that land whence
      No rumour reaches us.

                                   

   Well Here at morn they’ll light on one
      Dangling in mockery
   Of what he spent his substance on
      Blindly and uselessly! . . .
         “He might,” they’ll say,
         “Have built, some way.
      A cheaper gallows-tree!”
