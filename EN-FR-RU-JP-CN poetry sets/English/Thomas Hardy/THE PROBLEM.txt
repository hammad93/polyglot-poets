      SHALL we conceal the Case, or tell it—
         We who believe the evidence
      Here and there the watch-towers knell it
         With a sullen significance,
   Heard of the few who hearken intently and carry an eagerly upstrained
   sense.

      Hearts that are happiest hold not by it;
         Better we let, then, the old view reign;
      Since there is peace in it, why decry it
         Since there is comfort, why disdain
   Note not the pigment the while that the painting determines humanity’s
   joy and pain!
