   I SAT in the Muses’ Hall at the mid of the day,
   And it seemed to grow still, and the people to pass away,
   And the chiselled shapes to combine in a haze of sun,
   Till beside a Carrara column there gleamed forth One.

   She was nor this nor that of those beings divine,
   But each and the whole—an essence of all the Nine;
   With tentative foot she neared to my halting-place,
   A pensive smile on her sweet, small, marvellous face.

   “Regarded so long, we render thee sad” said she.
   “Not you,” sighed I, “but my own inconstancy!
   I worship each and each; in the morning one,
   And then, alas! another at sink of sun.

   “To-day my soul clasps Form; but where is my troth
   Of yesternight with Tune can one cleave to both”
   —“Be not perturbed,” said she.  “Though apart in fame,
   As I and my sisters are one, those, too, are the same.

   —“But my loves go further—to Story, and Dance, and Hymn,
   The lover of all in a sun-sweep is fool to whim—
   Is swayed like a river-weed as the ripples run!”
   —“Nay, wight, thou sway’st not.  These are but phases of one;

   “And that one is I; and I am projected from thee,
   One that out of thy brain and heart thou causest to be—
   Extern to thee nothing.  Grieve not, nor thyself becall,
   Woo where thou wilt; and rejoice thou canst love at all!”
