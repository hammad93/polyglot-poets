      UNDER a daisied bank
   There stands a rich red ruminating cow,
      And hard against her flank
   A cotton-hooded milkmaid bends her brow.

      The flowery river-ooze
   Upheaves and falls; the milk purrs in the pail;
      Few pilgrims but would choose
   The peace of such a life in such a vale.

      The maid breathes words—to vent,
   It seems, her sense of Nature’s scenery,
      Of whose life, sentiment,
   And essence, very part itself is she.

      She bends a glance of pain,
   And, at a moment, lets escape a tear;
      Is it that passing train,
   Whose alien whirr offends her country ear—

      Nay!  Phyllis does not dwell
   On visual and familiar things like these;
      What moves her is the spell
   Of inner themes and inner poetries

      Could but by Sunday morn
   Her gay new gown come, meads might dry to dun,
      Trains shriek till ears were torn,
   If Fred would not prefer that Other One.
