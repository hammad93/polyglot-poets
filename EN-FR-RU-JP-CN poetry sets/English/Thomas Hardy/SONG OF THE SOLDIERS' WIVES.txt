   AT last!  In sight of home again,
         Of home again;
   No more to range and roam again
      As at that bygone time
   No more to go away from us
         And stay from us—
   Dawn, hold not long the day from us,
      But quicken it to prime!

                                    

   Now all the town shall ring to them,
         Shall ring to them,
   And we who love them cling to them
      And clasp them joyfully;
   And cry, “O much we’ll do for you
         Anew for you,
   Dear Loves!—aye, draw and hew for you,
      Come back from oversea.”

                                   

   Some told us we should meet no more,
         Should meet no more;
   Should wait, and wish, but greet no more
      Your faces round our fires;
   That, in a while, uncharily
         And drearily
   Men gave their lives—even wearily,
      Like those whom living tires.

                                    

   And now you are nearing home again,
         Dears, home again;
   No more, may be, to roam again
      As at that bygone time,
   Which took you far away from us
         To stay from us;
   Dawn, hold not long the day from us,
      But quicken it to prime!
