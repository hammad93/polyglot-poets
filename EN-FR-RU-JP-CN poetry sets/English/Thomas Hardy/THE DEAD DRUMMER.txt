   THEY throw in Drummer Hodge, to rest
      Uncoffined—just as found
   His landmark is a kopje-crest
      That breaks the veldt around;
   And foreign constellations west
      Each night above his mound.

                                    

   Young Hodge the Drummer never knew—
      Fresh from his Wessex home—
   The meaning of the broad Karoo,
      The Bush, the dusty loam,
   And why uprose to nightly view
      Strange stars amid the gloam.

                                   

   Yet portion of that unknown plain
      Will Hodge for ever be;
   His homely Northern breast and brain
      Grow up a Southern tree.
   And strange-eyed constellations reign
      His stars eternally.
