   NEVER a careworn wife but shows,
      If a joy suffuse her,
   Something beautiful to those
      Patient to peruse her,
   Some one charm the world unknows
      Precious to a muser,
   Haply what, ere years were foes,
      Moved her mate to choose her.

                                    

   But, be it a hint of rose
      That an instant hues her,
   Or some early light or pose
      Wherewith thought renews her—
   Seen by him at full, ere woes
      Practised to abuse her—
   Sparely comes it, swiftly goes,
      Time again subdues her.
