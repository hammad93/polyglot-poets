   WHENCE comes Solace—Not from seeing
   What is doing, suffering, being,
   Not from noting Life’s conditions,
   Nor from heeding Time’s monitions;
      But in cleaving to the Dream,
      And in gazing at the gleam
      Whereby gray things golden seem.

                                    

   Thus do I this heyday, holding
   Shadows but as lights unfolding,
   As no specious show this moment
   With its irisèd embowment;
      But as nothing other than
      Part of a benignant plan;
      Proof that earth was made for man.
