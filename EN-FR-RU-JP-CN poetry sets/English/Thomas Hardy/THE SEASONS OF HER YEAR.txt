   WINTER is white on turf and tree,
      And birds are fled;
   But summer songsters pipe to me,
      And petals spread,
   For what I dreamt of secretly
      His lips have said!

                                    

   O ’tis a fine May morn, they say,
      And blooms have blown;
   But wild and wintry is my day,
      My birds make moan;
   For he who vowed leaves me to pay
      Alone—alone!
