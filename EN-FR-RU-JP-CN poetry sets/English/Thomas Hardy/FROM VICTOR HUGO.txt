   CHILD, were I king, I’d yield my royal rule,
      My chariot, sceptre, vassal-service due,
   My crown, my porphyry-basined waters cool,
   My fleets, whereto the sea is but a pool,
      For a glance from you!

   Love, were I God, the earth and its heaving airs,
      Angels, the demons abject under me,
   Vast chaos with its teeming womby lairs,
   Time, space, all would I give—aye, upper spheres,
      For a kiss from thee!
