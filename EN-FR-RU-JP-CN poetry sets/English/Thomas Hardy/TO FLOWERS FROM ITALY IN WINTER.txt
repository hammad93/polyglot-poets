   SUNNED in the South, and here to-day;
      —If all organic things
   Be sentient, Flowers, as some men say,
      What are your ponderings

   How can you stay, nor vanish quite
      From this bleak spot of thorn,
   And birch, and fir, and frozen white
      Expanse of the forlorn

   Frail luckless exiles hither brought!
      Your dust will not regain
   Old sunny haunts of Classic thought
      When you shall waste and wane;

   But mix with alien earth, be lit
      With frigid Boreal flame,
   And not a sign remain in it
      To tell men whence you came.
