   “POOR wanderer,” said the leaden sky,
      “I fain would lighten thee,
   But there be laws in force on high
      Which say it must not be.”

             
   —“I would not freeze thee, shorn one,” cried
      The North, “knew I but how
   To warm my breath, to slack my stride;
      But I am ruled as thou.”


   —“To-morrow I attack thee, wight,”
      Said Sickness.  “Yet I swear
   I bear thy little ark no spite,
      But am bid enter there.”


   —“Come hither, Son,” I heard Death say;
      “I did not will a grave
   Should end thy pilgrimage to-day,
      But I, too, am a slave!”


   We smiled upon each other then,
      And life to me wore less
   That fell contour it wore ere when
      They owned their passiveness.
