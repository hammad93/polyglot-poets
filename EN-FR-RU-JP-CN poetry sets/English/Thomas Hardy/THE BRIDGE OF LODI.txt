   WHEN of tender mind and body
      I was moved by minstrelsy,
   And that strain “The Bridge of Lodi”
      Brought a strange delight to me.

                                    

   In the battle-breathing jingle
      Of its forward-footing tune
   I could see the armies mingle,
      And the columns cleft and hewn

                                   

   On that far-famed spot by Lodi
      Where Napoleon clove his way
   To his fame, when like a god he
      Bent the nations to his sway.

                                    

   Hence the tune came capering to me
      While I traced the Rhone and Po;
   Nor could Milan’s Marvel woo me
      From the spot englamoured so.

                                    

   And to-day, sunlit and smiling,
      Here I stand upon the scene,
   With its saffron walls, dun tiling,
      And its meads of maiden green,

                                    

   Even as when the trackway thundered
      With the charge of grenadiers,
   And the blood of forty hundred
      Splashed its parapets and piers . . .

                                   

   Any ancient crone I’d toady
      Like a lass in young-eyed prime,
   Could she tell some tale of Lodi
      At that moving mighty time.

                                   

   So, I ask the wives of Lodi
      For traditions of that day;
   But alas! not anybody
      Seems to know of such a fray.

                                    

   And they heed but transitory
      Marketings in cheese and meat,
   Till I judge that Lodi’s story
      Is extinct in Lodi’s street.

                                    

   Yet while here and there they thrid them
      In their zest to sell and buy,
   Let me sit me down amid them
      And behold those thousands die . . .

                                    

   —Not a creature cares in Lodi
      How Napoleon swept each arch,
   Or where up and downward trod he,
      Or for his memorial March!

                                   

   So that wherefore should I be here,
      Watching Adda lip the lea,
   When the whole romance to see here
      Is the dream I bring with me

                                   

   And why sing “The Bridge of Lodi”
      As I sit thereon and swing,
   When none shows by smile or nod he
      Guesses why or what I sing . . .

                                   

   Since all Lodi, low and head ones,
      Seem to pass that story by,
   It may be the Lodi-bred ones
      Rate it truly, and not I.

                                    

   Once engrossing Bridge of Lodi,
      Is thy claim to glory gone
   Must I pipe a palinody,
      Or be silent thereupon

                                   

   And if here, from strand to steeple,
      Be no stone to fame the fight,
   Must I say the Lodi people
      Are but viewing crime aright

                                   

   Nay; I’ll sing “The Bridge of Lodi”—
      That long-loved, romantic thing,
   Though none show by smile or nod he
      Guesses why and what I sing!
