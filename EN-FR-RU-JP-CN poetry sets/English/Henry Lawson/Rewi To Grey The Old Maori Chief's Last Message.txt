We have lived till these times, brother,
We who lived in this;
We have not grown old together,
Soon our lives must close –
Rewi’s first! For I am dying
Ere I got where all is true
From my heart a wish is flying –
This is my great word to you
Mine to you and those who love us –
Be they white or brown –
Let there be one stone above is
When they’ve laid us down;
Let us rest together, brother,
When our gods recall us two.
Grant my wish – I have no other
This is my great word to you.
Let there be one stone above us,
Standing for a sign
On one side your name be written
On the other mine.
In my heart your name is lying;
We shall meet where all is true –
From y heart this wish is flying
This is my great word to you.
