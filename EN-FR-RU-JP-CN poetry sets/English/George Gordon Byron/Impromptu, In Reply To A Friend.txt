When, from the heart where Sorrow sits,
Her dusky shadow mounts too high,
And o'er the changing aspect flits,
And clouds the brow, or fills the eye;
Heed not that gloom, which soon shall sink
My thoughts their dungeon know too well;
Back to my breast the wanderers shrink,
And droop within their silent cell.
