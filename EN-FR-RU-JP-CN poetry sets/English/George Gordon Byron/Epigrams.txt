Oh, Castlereagh! thou art a patriot now;
Cato died for his country, so didst thou
He perish'd rather than see Rome en­slaved,
Thou cutt' st thy throat that Britain may be saved!
So Castlereagh has cut his throat!--The worst
Of this is, - that his own was not the first.
So He has cut his throat at last!--He! Who
The man who cut his country's long ago.
