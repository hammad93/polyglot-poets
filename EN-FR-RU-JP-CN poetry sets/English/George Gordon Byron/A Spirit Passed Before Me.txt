A spirit passed before me I beheld
The face of immortality unveiled--
Deep sleep came down on every eye save mine--
And there it stood,--all formless--but divine
Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;
And as my damp hair stiffened, thus it spake
'Is man more just than God Is man more pure
Than He who deems even Seraphs insecure
Creatures of clay--vain dwellers in the dust!
The moth survives you, and are ye more just
Things of a day! you wither ere the night,
Heedless and blind to Wisdom's wasted light!'
