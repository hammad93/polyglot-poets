Dark eyes are dearer far
Than those that mock the hyacinthine bell.
Blue! 'Tis the life of heaven,&mdash;the domain
Of Cynthia,&mdash;the wide palace of the sun,&mdash;
The tent of Hesperus, and all his train,&mdash;
The bosomer of clouds, gold, gray, and dun.
Blue! 'Tis the life of waters&mdash;Ocean
And all its vassal streams, pools numberless,
May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can
Subside, if not to dark-blue nativeness.
Blue! gentle cousin of the forest-green,
Married to green in all the sweetest flowers&mdash;
Forget-me-not,&mdash;the blue-bell,&mdash;and, that queen
Of secrecy, the violet what strange powers
Hast thou, as a mere shadow! But how great,
When in an Eye thou art alive with fate!
