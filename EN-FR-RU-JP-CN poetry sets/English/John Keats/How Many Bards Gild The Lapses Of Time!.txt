How many bards gild the lapses of time!
A few of them have ever been the food
Of my delighted fancy,&mdash;I could brood
Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime
And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,
These will in throngs before my mind intrude
But no confusion, no disturbance rude
Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.
So the unnumbered sounds that evening store;
The songs of birds&mdash;the whispering of the leaves&mdash;
The voice of waters&mdash;the great bell that heaves
With solemn sound,&mdash;and thousand others more,
That distance of recognizance bereaves,
Makes pleasing music, and not wild uproar.
