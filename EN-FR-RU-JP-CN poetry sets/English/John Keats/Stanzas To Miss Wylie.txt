O come Georgiana! the rose is full blown,
The riches of Flora are lavishly strown,
The air is all softness, and crystal the streams,
The West is resplendently clothed in beams.

O come! let us haste to the freshening shades,
The quaintly carv'd seats, and the opening glades;
Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns,
And in the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims.

And when thou art weary I'll find thee a bed,
Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head
And there Georgiana I'll sit at thy feet,
While my story of love I enraptur'd repeat.

So fondly I'll breathe, and so softly I'll sigh,
Thou wilt think that some amorous Zephyr is nigh
Yet no -- as I breathe I will press thy fair knee,
And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me.

Ah! why dearest girl should we lose all these blisses
That mortal's a fool who such happiness misses
So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand,
With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland.
