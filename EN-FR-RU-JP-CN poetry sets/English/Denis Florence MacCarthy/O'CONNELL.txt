Harp of my native land
That lived anew 'neath Carolan's master hand;
Harp on whose electric chords,
The minstrel Moore's melodious words,
Each word a bird that sings,
Borne as if on Ariel's wings,
      Touched every tender soul
      From listening pole to pole.
Sweet harp, awake once more
What, though a ruder hand disturbs thy rest,
      A theme so high
      Will its own worth supply.
As finest gold is ever moulded best
Or as a cannon on some festive day,
When sea and sky, when winds and waves rejoice,
Out-booms with thunderous voice,
Bids echo speak, and all the hills obey--

So let the verse in echoing accents ring,
      So proudly sing,
      With intermittent wail,
The nation's dead, but sceptred King,
The glory of the Gael.
