Need I say how much I love thee--
  Need my weak words tell,
That I prize but heaven above thee,
  Earth not half so well
If this truth has failed to move thee,
  Hope away must flee;
If thou dost not feel I love thee,
  Vain my words would be!

Need I say how long I've sought thee--
  Need my words declare,
Dearest, that I long have thought thee
  Good and wise and fair
If no sigh this truth has brought thee,
  Woe, alas! to me;
Where thy own heart has not taught thee,
  Vain my words would be!

Need I say when others wooed thee,
  How my breast did pine,
Lest some fond heart that pursued thee
  Dearer were than mine
If no pity then came to thee,
  Mixed with love for me,
Vainly would my words imbue thee,
  Vain my words would be!

Love's best language is unspoken,
  Yet how simply known;
Eloquent is every token,
  Look, and touch, and tone.
If thy heart hath not awoken,
  If not yet on thee
Love's sweet silent light hath broken,
  Vain my words would be!

Yet, in words of truest meaning,
  Simple, fond, and few;
By the wild waves intervening,
  Dearest, I love you!
Vain the hopes my heart is gleaning,
  If, long since to thee,
My fond heart required unscreening,
  Vain my words will be!
