To give the blossom and the fruit
  The soft warm air that wraps them round,
Oh! think how long the toilsome root
  Must live and labour 'neath the ground.

To send the river on its way,
  With ever deepening strength and force,
Oh! think how long 'twas let to play,
  A happy streamlet, near its source.
