We have mourned and sighed for our buried pride,
  We have given what nature gives,
A manly tear o'er a brother's bier,
  But now for the Land that lives!
He who passed too soon, in his glowing noon,
  The hope of our youthful band,
From heaven's blue wall doth seem to call
  Think, think of your Living Land!
I dwell serene in a happier scene,
  Ye dwell in a Living Land!

Yes! yes! dear shade, thou shalt be obeyed,
  We must spend the hour that flies,
In no vain regret for the sun that has set,
  But in hope for another to rise;
And though it delay with its guiding ray,
  We must each, with his little brand,
Like sentinels light through the dark, dark night,
  The steps of our Living Land.
She needeth our care in the chilling air--
  Our old, dear Living Land!

Yet our breasts will throb, and the tears will throng
  To our eyes for many a day,
For an eagle in strength and a lark in song
  Was the spirit that passed away.
Though his heart be still as a frozen rill,
  And pulseless his glowing hand,
We must struggle the more for that old green shore
  He was making a Living Land.
By him we have lost, at whatever the cost,
  She must be a Living Land!

A Living Land, such as Nature plann'd,
  When she hollowed our harbours deep,
When she bade the grain wave o'er the plain,
  And the oak wave over the steep
When she bade the tide roll deep and wide,
  From its source to the ocean strand,
Oh! it was not to slaves she gave these waves,
  But to sons of a Living Land!
Sons who have eyes and hearts to prize
  The worth of a Living Land!

Oh! when shall we lose the hostile hues,
  That have kept us so long apart
Or cease from the strife, that is crushing the life
  From out of our mother's heart
Could we lay aside our doubts and our pride,
  And join in a common band,
One hour would see our country free,
  A young and a Living Land!
With a nation's heart and a nation's part,
  A free and a Living Land!
