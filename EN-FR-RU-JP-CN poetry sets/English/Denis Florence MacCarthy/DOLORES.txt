The moon of my soul is dark, Dolores,
  Dead and dark in my breast it lies,
For I miss the heaven of thy smile, Dolores,
  And the light of thy brown bright eyes.

The rose of my heart is gone, Dolores,
  Bud or blossom in vain I seek;
For I miss the breath of thy lip, Dolores,
  And the blush of thy pearl-pale cheek.

The pulse of my heart is still, Dolores,
  Still and chill is its glowing tide;
For I miss the beating of thine, Dolores,
  In the vacant space by my side.

But the moon shall revisit my soul, Dolores,
  And the rose shall refresh my heart,
When I meet thee again in heaven, Dolores,
  Never again to part.
