Let us seek the modest May,
    She is down in the glen,
      Hiding and abiding
    From the common gaze of men,
  Where the silver streamlet crosses
  O'er the smooth stones green with mosses,
      And glancing and dancing,
    Goes singing on its way--
We shall find the modest maiden there to-day.

Let us seek the merry May,
    She is up on the hill,
      Laughing and quaffing
    From the fountain and the rill.
  Where the southern zephyr sprinkles,
  Like bright smiles on age's wrinkles,
      O'er the edges and ledges
  Of the rocks, the wild flowers gay--
We shall find the merry maiden there to-day.

Let us seek the musing May,
    She is deep in the wood,
      Viewing and pursuing
    The beautiful and good.
  Where the grassy bank receding,
  Spreads its quiet couch for reading
      The pages of the sages,
    And the poet's lyric lay--
We shall find the musing maiden there to-day.

Let us seek the mirthful May,
    She is out on the strand
      Racing and chasing
    The ripples o'er the sand.
  Where the warming waves discover
  All the treasures that they cover,
      Whitening and brightening
    The pebbles for her play--
We shall find the mirthful maiden there to-day.

Let us seek the wandering May,
    She is off to the plain,
      Finding the winding
    Of the labyrinthine lane.
  She is passing through its mazes
  While the hawthorn, as it gazes
      With grief, lets its leaflets
    Whiten all the way--
We shall find the wandering maiden there to-day.

Let us seek her in the ray--
    Let us track her by the rill--
      Wending ascending
    The slopings of the hill.
  Where the robin from the copses
  Breathes a love-note, and then drops his
      Trilling, till, willing,
    His mate responds his lay--
We shall find the listening maiden there to-day.

But why seek her far away
    Like a young bird in its nest,
      She is warming and forming
    Her dwelling in her breast.
  While the heart she doth repose on,
  Like the down the sunwind blows on,
      Gloweth, yet showeth
    The trembling of the ray--
We shall find the happy maiden there to-day.
