Ethna, to cull sweet flowers divinely fair,
  To seek for gems of such transparent light
  As would not be unworthy to unite
Round thy fair brow, and through thy dark-brown hair,
I would that I had wings to cleave the air,
  In search of some far region of delight,
  That back to thee from that adventurous flight,
A glorious wreath my happy hands might bear;
  Soon would the sweetest Persian rose be thine--
Soon would the glory of Golconda's mine
Flash on thy forehead, like a star--ah! me,
  In place of these, I bring, with trembling hand,
These fading wild flowers from our native land--
  These simple pebbles from the Irish Sea!
