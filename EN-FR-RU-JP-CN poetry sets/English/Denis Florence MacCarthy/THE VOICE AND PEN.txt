Oh! the orator's voice is a mighty power,
  As it echoes from shore to shore,
And the fearless pen has more sway o'er men
  Than the murderous cannon's roar!
What burst the chain far over the main,
  And brighten'd the captive's den
'Twas the fearless pen and the voice of power,
  Hurrah! for the Voice and Pen!
                                Hurrah!
  Hurrah! for the Voice and Pen!

The tyrant knaves who deny man's rights,
  And the cowards who blanch with fear,
Exclaim with glee  No arms have ye,
  Nor cannon, nor sword, nor spear!
Your hills are ours--with our forts and towers
  We are masters of mount and glen!
Tyrants, beware! for the arms we bear
  Are the Voice and the fearless Pen!
                                Hurrah!
  Hurrah! for the Voice and Pen!

Though your horsemen stand with their bridles in hand,
  And your sentinels walk around!
Though your matches flare in the midnight air,
  And your brazen trumpets sound!
Oh! the orator's tongue shall be heard among
  These listening warrior men;
And they'll quickly say  Why should we slay
  Our friends of the Voice and Pen
                                Hurrah!
  Hurrah! for the Voice and Pen!

When the Lord created the earth and sea,
  The stars and the glorious sun,
The Godhead spoke, and the universe woke
  And the mighty work was done!
Let a word be flung from the orator's tongue,
  Or a drop from the fearless pen,
And the chains accursed asunder burst
  That fettered the minds of men!
                                Hurrah!
  Hurrah! for the Voice and Pen!

Oh! these are the swords with which we fight,
  The arms in which we trust,
Which no tyrant hand will dare to brand,
  Which time cannot dim or rust!
When these we bore we triumphed before,
  With these we'll triumph again!
And the world will say no power can stay
  The Voice and the fearless Pen!
                                Hurrah!
  Hurrah! for the Voice and Pen!
