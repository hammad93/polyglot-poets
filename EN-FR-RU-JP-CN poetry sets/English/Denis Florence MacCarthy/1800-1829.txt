Yet! 'twas on that barren strand
Sing his praise throughout the world!
  Yet, 'twas on that barren strand,
O'er a cowed and broken band,
  That his solitary hand
    Freedom's flag unfurled.
Yet! 'twas there in Freedom's cause,
  Freedom from unequal laws,
  Freedom for each creed and class,
  For humanity's whole mass,
    That his voice outrang;--
  And the nation at a bound,
  Stirred by the inspiring sound,
    To his side up-sprang.

Then the mighty work began,
Then the war of thirty years--
Peaceful war, when words were spears,
And religion led the van.
When O'Connell's voice of power,
Day by day and hour by hour,
Raining down its iron shower,
  Laid oppression low,
Till at length the war was o'er,
And Napoleon's conqueror,
Yielded to a mightier foe.
