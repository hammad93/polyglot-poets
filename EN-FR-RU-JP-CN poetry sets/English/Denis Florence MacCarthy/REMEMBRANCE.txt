With that pleasant smile thou wearest,
Thou art gazing on the fairest
  Wonders of the earth and sea
Do thou not, in all thy seeing,
Lose the mem'ry of one being
  Who at home doth think of thee.

In the capital of nations,
Sun of all earth's constellations,
  Thou art roaming glad and free
Do thou not, in all thy roving,
Lose the mem'ry of one loving
  Heart at home that beats for thee.

Strange eyes around thee glisten,
To a strange tongue thou dost listen,
  Strangers bend the suppliant knee
Do thou not, for all their seeming
Truth, forget the constant beaming
  Eyes at home that watch for thee.

Stately palaces surround thee,
Royal parks and gardens bound thee--
  Gardens of the 'Fleur de Lis'
Do thou not, for all their splendour,
Quite forget the humble, tender
  Thoughts at home, that turn to thee.

When, at length of absence weary,
When the year grows sad and dreary,
  And an east wind sweeps the sea;
Ere the days of dark November,
Homeward turn, and then remember
  Hearts at home that pine for thee!
