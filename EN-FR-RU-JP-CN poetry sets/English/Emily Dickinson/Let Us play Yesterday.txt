Let Us play Yesterday - 
I - the Girl at school - 
You - and Eternity - the
Untold Tale - 
Easing my famine
At my Lexicon - 
Logarithm - had I - for Drink - 
Twas a dry Wine - 
Somewhat different - must be - 
Dreams tint the Sleep - 
Cunning Reds of Morning
Make the Blind - leap - 
Still at the Egg-life - 
Chafing the Shell - 
When you troubled the Ellipse - 
And the Bird fell - 
Manacles be dim - they say - 
To the new Free - 
Liberty - Commoner - 
Never could - to me - 
'Twas my last gratitude
When I slept - at night - 
'Twas the first Miracle
Let in - with Light - 
Can the Lark resume the Shell - 
Easier - for the Sky - 
Wouldn't Bonds hurt more
Than Yesterday
Wouldn't Dungeons sorer frate
On the Man - free - 

Just long enough to taste - 
Then - doomed new - 
God of the Manacle
As of the Free - 
Take not my Liberty
Away from Me -
