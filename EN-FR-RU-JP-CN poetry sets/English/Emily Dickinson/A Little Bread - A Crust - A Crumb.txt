A little bread - a crust - a crumb - 
A little trust - a demijohn - 
Can keep the soul alive - 
Not portly, mind! but breathing - warm - 
Conscious - as old Napoleon,
The night before the Crown!
A modest lot - A fame petite - 
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet
Is plenty! Is enough!
A Sailor's business is the shore!
A Soldier's - balls! Who asketh more,
Must seek the neighboring life!
