Again - his voice is at the door - 
I feel the old Degree - 
I hear him ask the servant
For such an one - as me - 
I take a flower - as I go - 
My face to justify - 
He never saw me - in this life - 
I might surprise his eye!
I cross the Hall with mingled steps - 
I - silent - pass the door - 
I look on all this world contains - 
Just his face - nothing more!
We talk in careless - and it toss - 
A kind of plummet strain - 
Each - sounding - shyly - 
Just - how - deep - 
The other's one - had been - 
We walk - I leave my Dog - at home - 
A tender - thoughtful Moon - 
Goes with us - just a little way - 
And - then - we are alone - 
Alone - if Angels are alone - 
First time they try the sky!
Alone - if those veiled faces - be - 
We cannot count - on High!
I'd give - to live that hour - again - 
The purple - in my Vein - 
But He must count the drops - himself - 
My price for every stain!
