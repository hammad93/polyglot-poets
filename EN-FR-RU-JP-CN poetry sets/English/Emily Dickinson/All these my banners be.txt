All these my banners be.
I sow my pageantry
In May - 
It rises train by train - 
Then sleeps in state again - 
My chancel - all the plain
 Today.
To lose - if one can find again - 
To miss - if one shall meet - 
The Burglar cannot rob - then - 
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine - 
You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know - 
Let us chant it softly - 
There is no more snow!
To him who keeps an Orchis' heart - 
The swamps are pink with June.
