A clock stopped -- not the mantel's
 Geneva's farthest skill
Can't put the puppet bowing
 That just now dangled still.
An awe came on the trinket!
 The figures hunched with pain,
Then quivered out of decimals
 Into degreeless noon.
It will not stir for doctors,
 This pendulum of snow;
The shopman importunes it,
 While cool, concernless No
Nods from the gilded pointers,
 Nods from seconds slim,
Decades of arrogance between
 The dial life and him.
