Good Morning—Midnight—
I'm coming Home—
Day—got tired of Me—
How could I—of Him
Sunshine was a sweet place—
I liked to stay—
But Morn—didn't want me—now—
So—Goodnight—Day!
I can look—can't I—
When the East is Red
The Hills—have a way—then—
That puts the Heart—abroad—
You—are not so fair—Midnight—
I chose—Day—
But—please take a little Girl—
He turned away!
