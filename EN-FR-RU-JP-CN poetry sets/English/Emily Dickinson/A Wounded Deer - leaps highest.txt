A Wounded Deer - leaps highest - 
I've heard the Hunter tell - 
Tis but the Ecstasy of death - 
And then the Brake is still!
The Smitten Rock that gushes!
The trampled Steel that springs!
A Cheek is always redder
Just where the Hectic stings!
Mirth is the Mail of Anguish
In which it Cautious Arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And you're hurt exclaim!
