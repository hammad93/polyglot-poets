Bring me the sunset in a cup,
Reckon the morning's flagons up
And say how many Dew,
Tell me how far the morning leaps - 
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
Who spun the breadth of blue!
Write me how many notes there be
In the new Robin's ecstasy
Among astonished boughs - 
How many trips the Tortoise makes - 
How many cups the Bee partakes,
The Debauchee of Dews!
Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
By withes of supple blue
Whose fingers string the stalactite - 
Who counts the wampum of the night
To see that none is due
Who built this little Alban House
And shut the windows down so close
My spirit cannot see
Who'll let me out some gala day
With implements to fly away,
Passing Pomposity
