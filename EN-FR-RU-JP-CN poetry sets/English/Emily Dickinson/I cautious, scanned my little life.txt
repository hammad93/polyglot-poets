I cautious, scanned my little life - 
I winnowed what would fade
From what would last till Heads like mine
Should be a-dreaming laid.
I put the latter in a Barn - 
The former, blew away.
I went one winter morning
And lo - my priceless Hay
Was not upon the Scaffold - 
Was not upon the Beam - 
And from a thriving Farmer - 
A Cynic, I became.
Whether a Thief did it - 
Whether it was the wind - 
Whether Deity's guiltless - 
My business is, to find!
So I begin to ransack!
How is it Hearts, with Thee
Art thou within the little Barn
Love provided Thee
