Many a phrase has the English language - 
I have heard but one - 
Low as the laughter of the Cricket,
Loud, as the Thunder's Tongue - 
Murmuring, like old Caspian Choirs,
When the Tide's a' lull - 
Saying itself in new infection - 
Like a Whippoorwill - 
Breaking in bright Orthography
On my simple sleep - 
Thundering its Prospective - 
Till I stir, and weep - 
Not for the Sorrow, done me - 
But the push of Joy - 
Say it again, Saxton!
Hush - Only to me!
