Not with a club, the Heart is broken,
 Nor with a stone;
A whip, so small you could not see it,
 I've known
To lash the magic creature
 Till it fell,
Yet that whip's name too noble
 Then to tell.
Magnanimous of bird
 By boy descried,
To sing unto the stone
 Of which it died.
Next The Only News I know
