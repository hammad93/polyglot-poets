You're right—the way is narrow—
And difficult the Gate—
And few there be—Correct again—
That enter in—thereat—
'Tis Costly—So are purples!
'Tis just the price of Breath—
With but the Discount of the Grave—
Termed by the Brokers—Death!
And after that—there's Heaven—
The Good Man's—Dividend—
And Bad Men—go to Jail—
I guess—
