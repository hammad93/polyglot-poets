Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town
So Sailors say - on yesterday - 
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up its strife
And gurgled down and down.
So angels say - on yesterday - 
Just as the dawn was red
One little boat - o'erspent with gales - 
Retrimmed its masts - redecked its sails - 
And shot - exultant on!
