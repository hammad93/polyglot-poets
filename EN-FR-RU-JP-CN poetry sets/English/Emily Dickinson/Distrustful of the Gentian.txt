Distrustful of the Gentian - 
And just to turn away,
The fluttering of her fringes
Child my perfidy - 
Weary for my -  -  -  -  - 
I will singing go - 
I shall not feel the sleet - then - 
I shall not fear the snow.
Flees so the phantom meadow
Before the breathless Bee - 
So bubble brooks in deserts
On Ears that dying lie - 
Burn so the Evening Spires
To Eyes that Closing go - 
Hangs so distant Heaven - 
To a hand below.
