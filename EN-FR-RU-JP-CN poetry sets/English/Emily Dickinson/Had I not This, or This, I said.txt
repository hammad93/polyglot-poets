Had I not This, or This, I said,
Appealing to Myself,
In moment of prosperity - 
Inadequate - were Life - 
Thou hast not Me, nor Me - it said,
In Moment of Reverse - 
And yet Thou art industrious - 
No need - hadst Thou - of us
My need - was all I had - I said - 
The need did not reduce - 
Because the food - exterminate - 
The hunger - does not cease - 
But diligence - is sharper - 
Proportioned to the Chance - 
To feed upon the Retrograde - 
Enfeebles - the Advance -
