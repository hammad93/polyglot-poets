Cocoon above! Cocoon below!
Stealthy Cocoon, why hide you so
What all the world suspect
An hour, and gay on every tree
Your secret, perched in ecstasy
Defies imprisonment!
An hour in Chrysalis to pass,
Then gay above receding grass
A Butterfly to go!
A moment to interrogate,
Then wiser than a Surrogate,
The Universe to know!
