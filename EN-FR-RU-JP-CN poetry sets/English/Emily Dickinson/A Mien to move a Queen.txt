A Mien to move a Queen - 
Half Child - Half Heroine - 
An Orleans in the Eye
That puts its manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a Tear - 
Its frequent Visitor - 
A Bonnet like a Duke - 
And yet a Wren's Peruke
Were not so shy
Of Goer by - 
And Hands - so slight - 
They would elate a Sprite
With Merriment - 
A Voice that Alters - Low
And on the Ear can go
Like Let of Snow - 
Or shift supreme - 
As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem - 
Too small - to fear - 
Too distant - to endear - 
And so Men Compromise
And just - revere -
