Good night! which put the candle out
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
 Ah! friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent;
 Extinguished, now, for you!
It might have been the lighthouse spark
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
 Had importuned to see!
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
 To purer reveille!
