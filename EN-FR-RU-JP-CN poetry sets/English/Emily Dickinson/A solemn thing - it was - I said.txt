A solemn thing - it was - I said - 
A woman - white - to be - 
And wear - if God should count me fit - 
Her blameless mystery - 
A hallowed thing - to drop a life
Into the purple well - 
Too plummetless - that it return - 
Eternity - until - 
I pondered how the bliss would look - 
And would it feel as big - 
When I could take it in my hand - 
As hovering - seen - through fog - 
And then - the size of this small life - 
The Sages - call it small - 
Swelled - like Horizons - in my vest - 
And I sneered - softly - small!
