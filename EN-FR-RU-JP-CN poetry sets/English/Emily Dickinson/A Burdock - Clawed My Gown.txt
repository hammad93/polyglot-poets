A Burdock - clawed my Gown - 
Not Burdock's - blame - 
But mine - 
Who went too near
The Burdock's Den - 
A Bog - affronts my shoe - 
What else have Bogs - to do - 
The only Trade they know - 
The splashing Men!
Ah, pity - then!
'Tis Minnows can despise!
The Elephant's - calm eyes
Look further on!
