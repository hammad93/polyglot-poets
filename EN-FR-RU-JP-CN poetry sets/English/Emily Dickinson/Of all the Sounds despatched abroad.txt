Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a Charge to me
Like that old measure in the Boughs - 
That phraseless Melody - 
The Wind does - working like a Hand,
Whose fingers Comb the Sky - 
Then quiver down - with tufts of Tune - 
Permitted Gods, and me - 
Inheritance, it is, to us - 
Beyond the Art to Earn - 
Beyond the trait to take away
By Robber, since the Gain
Is gotten not of fingers - 
And inner than the Bone - 
Hid golden, for the whole of Days,
And even in the Urn,
I cannot vouch the merry Dust
Do not arise and play
In some odd fashion of its own,
Some quainter Holiday,
When Winds go round and round in Bands - 
And thrum upon the door,
And Birds take places, overhead,
To bear them Orchestra.
I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs,
If such an Outcast be - 
Who never heard that fleshless Chant - 
Rise - solemn - on the Tree,
As if some Caravan of Sound
Off Deserts, in the Sky,
Had parted Rank,
Then knit, and swept - 
In Seamless Company -
