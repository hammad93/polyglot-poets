Heart, not so heavy as mine
Wending late home - 
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune - 
A careless snatch - a ballad - A ditty of the street - 
Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet - 
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled - 
Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way - 
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why!
Tomorrow, night will come again - 
Perhaps, weary and sore - 
Ah Bugle! By my window
I pray you pass once more.
