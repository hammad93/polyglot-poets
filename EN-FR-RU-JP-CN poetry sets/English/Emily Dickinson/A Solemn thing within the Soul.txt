A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe - 
And golden hang - while farther up - 
The Maker's Ladders stop - 
And in the Orchard far below - 
You hear a Being - drop - 
A Wonderful - to feel the Sun
Still toiling at the Cheek
You thought was finished - 
Cool of eye, and critical of Work - 
He shifts the stem - a little - 
To give your Core - a look - 
But solemnest - to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer - Every Sun
The Single - to some lives.
