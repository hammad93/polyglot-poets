The soul selects her own society,
 Then shuts the door;
 On her divine majority
 Obtrude no more.
 Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
 At her low gate;
 Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
 Upon her mat.
 I've known her from an ample nation
 Choose one
 Then close the valves of her attention
 Like stone.
