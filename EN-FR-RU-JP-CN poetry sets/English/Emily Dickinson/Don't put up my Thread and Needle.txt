Don't put up my Thread and Needle - 
I'll begin to Sew
When the Birds begin to whistle - 
Better Stitches - so - 
These were bent - my sight got crooked - 
When my mind - is plain
I'll do seams - a Queen's endeavor
Would not blush to own - 
Hems - too fine for Lady's tracing
To the sightless Knot - 
Tucks - of dainty interspersion - 
Like a dotted Dot - 
Leave my Needle in the furrow - 
Where I put it down - 
I can make the zigzag stitches
Straight - when I am strong - 
Till then - dreaming I am sewing
Fetch the seam I missed - 
Closer - so I - at my sleeping - 
Still surmise I stitch -
