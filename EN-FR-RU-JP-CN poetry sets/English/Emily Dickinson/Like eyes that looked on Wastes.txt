Like eyes that looked on Wastes - 
Incredulous of Ought
But Blank - and steady Wilderness - 
Diversified by Night - 
Just Infinites of Nought - 
As far as it could see - 
So looked the face I looked upon - 
So looked itself - on Me - 
I offered it no Help - 
Because the Cause was Mine - 
The Misery a Compact
As hopeless - as divine - 
Neither - would be absolved - 
Neither would be a Queen
Without the Other - Therefore - 
We perish - tho' We reign -
