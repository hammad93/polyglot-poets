Young men will love thee more fair and more fast;
Heard ye so merry the little bird sing
Old men's love the longest will last,
And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing.
The young man's wrath is like light straw on fire;
Heard ye so merry the little bird sing
But like red-hot steel is the old man's ire,
And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing.
The young man will brawl at the evening board;
Heard ye so merry the little bird sing
But the old man will draw at the dawning the sword,
And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing.
