The fountains mingle with the river,
 And the rivers with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever
 With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
 All things by a law divine
In another's being mingle--
 Why not I with thine
See, the mountains kiss high heaven,
 And the waves clasp one another;
No sister flower could be forgiven
 If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
 And the moonbeams kiss the sea;--
What are all these kissings worth,
 If thou kiss not me
